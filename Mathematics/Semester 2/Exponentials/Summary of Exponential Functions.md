- $a^{n}$ is known as a **power** [[Index Laws]]
- $a^{n}=a\times a\times...\times a$ (to $n$ factors) where $n$ is a positive integer and $a$ is a real number.
- $n$ us called the **index** or the **exponent** and $a$ is called the **base**.
- The **index laws** allow us to multiply and divide by powers. The index laws and extensions are:
	- $a^{m}\times a^{n}=a^{m+n}$
	- $a^{m}\div a^{n}=a^{m-n}$
	- $(a^{m})^{n}=a^{m\times n}$
	- $(ab)^{n}=a^{n}b^{n}$
	- $(\frac{a}{b})^{n}=\frac{a^{n}}{b^{n}}$
	- $a^{0}=1$
	- $a^{-n}=\frac{1}{a^{n}}$
	- $\frac{1}{a^{-n}}=a^{n}$
- The square root sign, $\sqrt{}$, is also called the **radical** sign. [[Radical and Fractional Indicies]]
- A number written in **scientific notation** is written between 1 and 10 multiplied by a power of 10. [[Scientific Notation and Significant Figures]]
- Numbers can be expressed to a desired number of significant figures according to the precision required. Digits that have meaning in terms of a numberâ€™s precision are called significant figures.
- A function of the form $f(x)=ab^{x}$ is called an **exponential function**. For $a$, $b > 0$ the domain is the real numbers and the range is the positive real numbers [[Exponential Functions]]
- The general form of a simple exponential function is
	$f(x) = Aax^{x+b}+c$
	where $a$ is the base and $A$, $b$ and $c$ are real constants
- The **graph of an exponential function** is always positive. For a growth function the slope increases with increasing values of $x$, while for a decay function the slope decreases. [[Transformatios of Exponential Graphs]]

- When sketching exponential functions in general form, key features are used:
	- The general shape
	- The asymptote (which is affected by the constant $c$).
	- The $y$-intercept (when $x\neq0$)
	- One other significant point
- Exponential graphs in the form $f(x)=Aa^{x+b}+c$ can also be sketched by **transforming** the graph of $y=a^{x}$
	- $A$ dilates the graph vertically by a factor is $A$, (stretched for $A>1$, compressed for $0<A<1$).
	- $b$ translates the graph horizontally (left for $b>0$, right for $b<0$).
	- $c$ translates the graph vertically (up for $c>0$, down for $c<0$)
- An exponential equation (indicial equation) is one where the variable is in an exponent. [[Exponential Equations]]
- Exponential (or indicial) equations may be solved algebraically by using the fact that if $a^{m}=a^{n}$, them $m=n$
- Exponential equations may also be solved using a CAS calculator.
- A function that grows or decays by a **constant factor** can be modelled as an exponential function of the form $f(x)=Aa^{x}$, where $A=f(0)$ is the **initial value** or starting point, $a$ is the **growth factor** or **base**, and $x$ is the **exponent** or **index**. For a **growth function** $a>1$, and for a **decay function** $a<1$. [[Exponential Modelling]]
