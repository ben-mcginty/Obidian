Scientific Notation (henceforth referred to as SciNot). involvs writing a given number between 1 and 10, multiplied by a power of 10.
The number is written in the form of $a\times10^{k}$, where $1\leq a<10$, and $k$ is an integer.

>[!example]+ Write in SciNot
>a) $9448800000=9.4488\times10^{9}$
>b) $0.00000005304=5.304\times10^{-8}$

Significant Figures (henceforth referred to as SigFigs) are related to rounding off.
To roundoff to a certain number of SigFigs, you count from the first non-zero digit.

>[!important]+
>When rounding off to a given number of SigFigs, first identify the last significant digit and then:
>- if the next digit is $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, or $4$, round down
>- if the next digit is $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$, round up
>It can help with rounding off it the original number is first written in SciNot.

>[!example]+
>In each case, round off to the number of SigFigs shown in the brackets and then express in scientific notation.
>a) $4592170$ (3 SigFigs) → $4.5\times10^{6}$
>b) $0.248391$ (2 SigFigs) → $2.5\times10^{-1}$
>c) $1.396794$ (3 SigFigs) → $1.40\times10^{0}$

>[!example]+
>Evaluate $534615\times613485$, writing your answers in scientiic notation correct to 3 SigFigs

Very large or very small numbers are usually written in scientific notation to make them easier to read. What could be done to make the figures in the following facts easier to read?
- The Bay of Fundy, Canada, has the largest tidal changes in the world.
About 100 000 000 000 tonnes of water are moved with each tide change.
- The dinosaurs dwelt on Earth for 185 000 000 years until they died out 65 000 000 years ago.
- The width of one plant cell is about 0.000 06 m.
- The total storage capacity of dams in Australia is about 83 853 000 000 000 litres and households in Australia use about 2 108 000 000 000 litres of water annually.
A number in scientific notation is written as a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by a power of 10.

>[!example]+ Example 7
>Write $320000000$ in scientific notation
>$320000000=⬜\times10^{⬜}$
>$=3.2\times10^{⬜}$
>$=3.2\times10^{8}$

>[!example]+ Example 8
>Write $7.1\times10^{-5}$
>$7.1\times10^{-5}=7.1\div10^{5}$

The concept of significant figures is related to rounding off. When you look at very large (or very small) numbers, some of the smaller digits are not significant.
For example, in a football crowd of 49 976, the 6 people are not really significant in terms of a crowd of about 50 000! Even the 76 people are not significant.
To round off to a certain number of significant figures, you count from the first non-zero digit.
In any number, non-zero digits are always significant. Zeros are not significant, except between two non-zero digits or at the end of a decimal number.
Scientific notation uses the significant figures in a number, so:
	$12000=1.20\times10^{4}$ (correct to 3 significant figures)
	$0.00004350=4.350\times10^{-5}$ (correct to 4 significant figures)
	$0.0207=2.07\times10^{-2}$ (correct to 3 significant figures)
When rounding off to significant figures, use the usual rules for rounding off.

>[!example]+ Example 9
>In each case below, round off to the number of significant figures shown in brackets
>a) $4 592 170$ (3 significant figures)
>	$4592170$
>	$4592170\approx4590000$
>b) $0.248 391$ (2 significant figures)
>	$0.248 391$
>	$0.248 391\approx0.25$
>c) $1.396 794$ (3 significant figures)
>	$1.396 794$
>	$1.396 794\approx1.40$
