- The average rate of change of a function from $x_{1}$ to $x_{2}$ is given by $\frac{f(x_{2})-f(x_{1})}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$.
- The instantaneous rate of change of a function if given by the derivative. it is called the gradient function and it gives the slope of the tangent at a point.
- Speed, velocity, acceleration and flow rate are all rates of change.
- For motion in a straight line:
	- the displacement is a change of position.
	- the derivative of position ($x$) or displacement ($s$) with respect to time ($t$) is velocity ($v$) and the derivative of velocity is acceleration ($a$).
	  $\frac{\delta s}{\delta t}=v$ and $\frac{\delta v}{\delta t}=a$
	- the antiderivative of velocity is position or displacement and the antiderivative of acceleration is velocity.
- The sign of the derivative shows whether a function is increasing, decreasing or stationary.
- At stationary points, the derivative is zero. The type of stationary is determined by the change of sign of the derivative near the stationary point.
	- A local minimum occurs when the derivative changes from negative to 0 to positive as $x$ increases.
	- A local maximum occurs when the derivative changes from positive to 0 to negative as $x$ increases.
	- A point of inflection occurs when the derivative has the same sign each side of a stationary point.

- A global maximum or global minimum value of a function is a maximum or minimum over the whole domain.
- To sketch a polynomial function, investigate the zeros, sign, stationary point/s, intervals where the function is increasing and decreasing $y$-intercept and behaviour as the magnitude of $x$ becomes large.
- Values of a function, its derivatives and stationary points can be estimated by reading from the graph of the function or by using numerical methods (on a calculator).
- To find the greatest and least values of a function in an interval, investigate the stationary points, $y$-intercepts and values of the function at the boundaries of the interval.
- When solving optimisation problems on an interval, use the following steps:
	- Read the problem carefully.
	- Draw a diagram and introduce variables for the unknown quantities.
	- List all known factors and relationships, showing relationships by equations.
	- Determine the quantity to be maximised or minimised and express it by a function of one variable.
	- Find the interval over which quantity.
	- Find the maximum or minimum and express the answer in terms of the question.
	- State any assumptions and examine the solution for possible extension to other cases.
