A is the global minimum value of $y$ in the graphed domain.
B is the local maximum where $f(x)=0$
C is the local minimum where $f(x)=0$
D is the global maximum value of $y$ in the graphed domain.

For many functions, a local minimum or maximum is also the global maximum or minimum.
For example, for $y=x^{2}$, the point $(0,0)$ is a local and global minimum.
The point that a direction changes is called a stationary inflection or inflexion.

>$\frac{\delta f(x)}{\delta x}=3x^{2}-6x-9$
>$3x^{2}-6x-9=(x+1)(x-3)$
>$\therefore$ stationary points are at $x=-1$ and $x=3$

Curve sketching is an important skill in mathematics. It helps you to understand what a function is likely to be like.

>[!example]+ Example 12
>The graph of f(x) is shown.
>![[Pasted image 20221025202432.png]]
>Use the graph to estimate:
>a. the coordinates of the stationary points
>	The stationary points are at about (−0.9, −30), (1.6, 10) and (4.3, −40).
>b. the $y$ value at $x=3$
>	The y value at $x = 3$ is about $−13$.
>c. the intervals where the function is increasing
>	The function is increasing for about $−0.9 < x < 1.6$ and $x > 4.3$.
>d. the rate of change at $x=2$
>	$(2, 8)$ and $(4, −13)$ lie on the tangent.
>	Rate of change = gradient of tangent
>	$\approx \frac{-13-8}{4-2}$
>	$=-10.5$
>	The rate of change at $x = 2$ is about $−10.5$.

The material in this section covers curve sketching with polynomial functions. There are key features of polynomial functions that provide important aids for sketching graphs.
These include the nature of stationary points, the $y$-intercept, zeros ($x$-intercepts) and behaviour as $x → ±∞$.

>[!important]+ Procedure and headings for sketching functions
>1. Zeros: If possible, determine the $x$-intercepts—the values of $x$ for which $f(x) = 0$.
>2. Sign: Determine the sign of $f(x)$ either side of zeros (for functions with them).
>3. Derivative (gradient function): Use the derivative to:
>	1. identify stationary points
>	2. determine the intervals in which the function is increasing or decreasing.
>4. y-intercept: Find the value of $f (0)$.
>5. Behaviour as $x → ±∞$: a dominant term is of higher power than any other term. As $x → ±∞$, the magnitude of the dominant term becomes much larger than the magnitudes of the other terms, so the function behaves like the dominant term.
>Then use your results to sketch the graph.
