A canvas shelter is made out of a back, two sides and a top. The area of canvas available is $24m^{2}$. Let $vm^{3}$ be the volume enclosed by the shelter. The sides are $xm^{2}$ each. 

1. find the dimensions of the shelter that will create the largest possible enclosed volume.
	1. $2x^{2}+2xy=24$
	2. $2xy=-2x^{2}+24$
	3. $y=-x+\frac{12}{x^{2}}$
	4. $V=x\times x\times (-x+ \frac{12}{x})$
	5. $=x^{2}\times (-x+ \frac{12}{x})$
	6. $=-x^{3}+12x$
	7. $\frac{\delta V}{\delta x}=-3x^{2}+12$
	8. $\therefore 0 = -3x^{2}+12$
	9. $3x^{2}=12$
	10. $x^{2}=4$
	11. $x=\pm2$
	12. $\therefore x=2$
	13. $V=16$

Often a problem involves finding maximum or minimum values that will provide an optimal outcome. For example, a salesperson wants to maximise profit; a warehouse manager wants to maximise storage; a driver wants to minimise petrol consumption; a farmer wants to maximise harvests. The process used to find optimum outcomes is called optimisation.
There is no single method for optimisation but calculus can be used for many of these problems.

>[!important]+ Solving optimisation problems on an interval
>1. Read the problem carefully—several times if needed. Think about the given facts, together with the unknown quantities that are to be found/optimised. 
>2. If possible, make a diagram and label it appropriately, introducing variables for the unknown quantities. Even when a diagram is not possible, identify variables and represent them with an appropriate symbol.
>3. List all known facts and relationships, showing relationships by equations if possible.
>4. Determine the quantity to be maximised or minimised and express it as a function of the other variables. Use the other equations to express all variables in terms of a single variable. Express the quantity as a function of the same variable.
>5. Find the interval over which the quantity is to be optimised by examining restrictions on the domain, whether explicit or implied.
>6. Find the maximum or minimum and express your answer in terms of the question.
>7. State any assumptions that you have made and examine your solution for possible extension to other cases.
