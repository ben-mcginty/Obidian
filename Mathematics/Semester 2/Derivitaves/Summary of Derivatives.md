- The derivative of the function $f(x)$ is written as $f'(x)$, $\frac{\delta f}{\delta x}$, or $\frac{\delta}{\delta x}f(x)$.
- The derivative of the function $f(x)$ is the gradient of the function at the point $x$, so $f'(x)$ is called the gradient function.
- The sign of the derivative shows whether a function is increasing $(f'(x)>0)$, decreasing $(f'(x)<0)$, or stationary$(f'(x)=0)$.
- The rules for finding derivatives where $a$, $b$ and $k$ are constants are:
	- If $y=f(x)=k$, then $\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}=f'(x)=0$
	- If $y=kf(x)$, then $\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}=kf'(x)=k\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}$
	- If $y=f(x)=kx^{n}$, then $\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}=f'(x)=knx^{n-1}$
	- $\frac{\delta}{\delta x}[f(x)+g(x)]=f'(x)+g'(x)$
	- $\frac{\delta}{\delta x}[f(x)-g(x)]=f'(x)-g'(x)$
	- $\frac{\delta}{\delta x}[af(x)+bg(x)]=af'(x)+bg'(x)$
- The derivative of a polynomial is found using the rules for the derivative of $x^{n}$ and linear combinations.
- The derivative of a function is the instantaneous rate of change of the function.
- The reverse of the process of differentiation is called antidifferentiation or integration ($\int, \iint, \iiint$).
- An antiderivative is also called a primitive or indefinite integral.
- The antiderivative of $ax^{n}$ is $\frac{ax^{n+1}}{n+1}$ (where $n\geq0$).
- If $F'(x)=f(x)$, then all antiderivatives are of the form $F(x)+c$.
