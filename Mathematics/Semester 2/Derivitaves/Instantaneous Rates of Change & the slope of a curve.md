In the last questions of Exercise 9.04 you proved the following.
>[!important]+
>The derivative of $y=kx^{n}$ is given by $\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}=knx^{n-1}$

In Chapter 7 you looked at the instantaneous rate of change of a function. In that chapter, you used the slope of a tangent drawn on a graph and numerical methods of approximation to find the rate of change.
The instantaneous rate of change of the function $y = f(x)$ is the limit of the average rate of change, given by $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$
Writing $x_{1}=x$, $x_{2}=x+h$, $y_{1}=f(x)$ and $y_{2}=f(x+h)$ gives $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{x+h-x}=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$
>[!important]+
>The (instantaneous) rate of change of a function at any point is the gradient of the tangent at that point, given by the derivative.
>The gradient of the tangent is called gradient of the graph. At the point $a$, the rate of change of the function is the slope of the tangent at the point $(a, f(a))$, which is the derivative.
>The derivative of a function at the point where $x = a$ is written as $f ′(a)$ or $\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}_{x=a}$

Notice in Example 12c that the derivative is a constant. It is the derivative of a linear function. It is the gradient of the function. A constant would have a derivative of $0$ as the gradient of $y = c$ is zero.
You already know that if y is a function of $x$, the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ is written as $\frac{dy}{dx}$ .
You can use other symbols for functions of course, meaning that you would use other symbols for the derivatives. For example, if $P$ is a function of $t$, you would write the function as $P(t)$ and its derivative as $P′(t)$ or $\frac{dP}{dt}$ .
An object’s position at any time is defined by $x$. Since its position depends on time, we often write it as $x(t)$, a function of time.
When something is moving in a straight line, you call its change of position from the starting position its displacement. This may be a positive or negative number depending on whether it is moving forwards or backwards (right or left).
You should also remember that the rate of change of displacement with respect to time is called velocity and the rate of change of velocity with respect to time is called acceleration.

>[!important]+
>**Distance** is how far an object or particle has travelled, regardless of direction.
>**Displacement**, $\Delta x$, is the change in position, $x(t)$, of the object or particle.
>**Velocity**, $v(t)$, is the rate of change of position with respect to time, so $v(t)=\frac{dx}{dt}$.
>**Acceleration**, $a(t)$, is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time, so $a(t)=\frac{dv}{dt}$.
