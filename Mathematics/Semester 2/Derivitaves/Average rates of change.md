A rate of change is worked out using the changes in variables instead of the variables themselves. The symbol $\Delta$ (Greek capital delta) is used to show the change in a quantity. You can find a rate of change even if the rate is not constant.

>[!important]+
>The rate of change of a quantity $y$ with respect to quantity $x$ is the quotient of their changes:
>$Rate~of~change~=\frac{change~in~second~quantity}{change~in~first~quantity}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$
>The first variable is taken as the independent variable. The second variable is the dependent variable.
>On a straight-line graph, the rate of change of the gradient of the line, $m=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}$.

The rate of change of a quantity, with no independent variable, means that the rate of change with respect to time. The phrase 'with respect to time' is often abbreviated to w.r.t.

>[!example]+ Example 1
>The volume of some dry air in a tube was measured at different temperatures but at the same pressure. The results are shown in the table below. Draw a graph and find the rate of change with respect to temperature using a line of best fit.

>Draw the graph with the temperature as the independent variable.

>Find the slope of the line. This calculation uses $(10,415)$ and $(190,678)$, but other points may be used.
>	$Gradient=\frac{rise}{run}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$
>	$\approx\frac{678-150}{190-10}$
>	$\approx1.46mL/\degree C$
>	$\therefore$ Rate of change is about $1.46mL/\degree C$

When you go for a trip, the speeds you travel on the way are not as important as the speed for the overall trip. In this case, you would need to use the average speed. This is an example of an average rate of change.

>[!important]+
>The average rate of change of a variable with respect to another between two points is:
>$\frac{second~value~of~dependent~variable-first~value~of~dependent~variable}{second~variable~of~independent~variable-first~variable~of~independent~variable}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$
>When the independent variable is time, average rate of change $x=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}$, assuming the change $\Delta x$ occurs over a time $\Delta t$.
>Speed is the rate of change of the total distance travelled by a moving object.
>Velocity is the rate of change of the displacement of a moving object. Displacement is the change in position from the starting point to the end point without regard for the direction travelled
>Acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of a moving object. Displacement, velocity and acceleration are considered to have a direction as well as a measure.
>Flow rate measures the speed at which a fluid travels and is the rate of change of volume.

>[!example]+ Example 2
>What is the average change of volume when a petrol tank is filled from 8L to 53L in 3 minutes?
>$=\frac{53-8}{3}$
>$=15L/min$
>The tank fills at $15L/min$.

The average of some rates of change is not the same as the average rate of change, as shown by the next example for speed.

>[!example]+ Example 3
>A delivery van takes a parcel to a customer and then returns to the depot. On the way to the customer it travels at 40 km/h and on the way back it travels at 60 km/h. Calculate the average speed and average velocity for the round trip of 90 km.
>$Time~going~to~customer=\frac{45}{40}=1.125h$
>$Time~returning=\frac{45}{60}=0.75h$
>$Total~time=1.875h$
>$Average~speed=\frac{90}{1.875}=48km/h$
>$Total~displacement=0km$
>$Total~velocity=\frac{0}{1.875}=0km/h$

>[!note]+ Investigation
>Forensic scientists, archaeologists and geologists use bone measurements to determine the characteristics of a person or animal. Sometimes the shape and size of a whole animal have been worked out from a single bone. It is possible for a forensic scientist or archaeologist to work out the height of a person by measuring a single bone.
>1. To begin this investigation, you will need to do some forensic investigation at home. Make the following measurements of people in your household! Don’t forget to include yourself. For each person:
>	1. Measure their height,
>	2. Note their sex,
>	3. Measure the length from the point of their elbow to the point of their shoulder, and,
>	4. Measure the length from their inside ankle knuckle to their kneecap (with the leg bent).
>2. Bring the information you have collected to class and pool it with the information collected by other class members.
>3. As part of your forensic analysis, make graphs of the pooled measurements and consider the relationships between height and other body measurements. Use a CAS calculator or spreadsheet to make this task easier.
>4. Write a report, describing the work that you did and any conclusions you reached. You should also make some conclusions about the reliability of the estimations of height (and weight) made by scientists on the basis of bone measurements.
