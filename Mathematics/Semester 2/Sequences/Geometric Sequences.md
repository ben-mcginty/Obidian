A sequence of numbers in which each term is generated by multiplying the preceding term by a non-zero constant number is called a geometric progression or geometric sequence.
>[!Important]+
>A geometric progression (GP) has a common ratio r. It is the multiplicative constant that is the ratio between successive terms, written as $r=t_{n}÷t_{n-1}$ or $r=\frac{t_{n}}{t_{n-1}}$.
>A GP can be defined recursively as $t_{n}=r\times t_{n-1}$, for $n \geq 2$.
>The first term is sometimes written as $a$.

>[!Example]+ Example 13 | It is a geometric sequence?
>Is $\frac{1}{4}$, $\frac{1}{6}$, $\frac{1}{18}$,… a geometric sequence?
>$r=\frac{1}{6}÷\frac{1}{4}=\frac{2}{3}$
>$r=\frac{1}{18}÷\frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{3}$
>Therefore, the sequence is not geometric as there is no common ratio.

>[!Example]+ Example 14 | Find the common ratio

>$6÷3=2$
>$12÷6=2$

>$x^{2}=5 \times 45=225$

Describe geometric sequences in terms of the first term $t_{1}$ and common ratio ($r$).
	First term $t_{1}=t_{1}$
	Second term $t_{2}=t_{1}\times r$
	Third term $t_{3}=t_{1}\times r \times r=t_{1}\times r^{2}$
	Fourth term $t_{4}=t_{1}\times r \times r \times r=t_{1}\times r^{3}$
	$n$th term $t_{n}=t_{1}\times r^{n-1}$
The general term ($t_{n}$) can be written as $t_{n}\times r^{n-1}$ or $ar^{n-1}$

**Geometric sequences**
A sequence in which each sucessive term is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed amount is called a **geometric sequence**
A geometric sequence has a recurrence relation in the form $t_{n}=rt_{n-1}$ where $r$ is a constant.

>[!note]+
>If two sucessive terms are given then $r$ can be calculated

The $n$th term of a geometric sequence is given by $t_{n}=ar^{n-1}$ where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the **common ratio** of sucessive terms. i.e. $r=t_{n}/t_{n-1}$

>[!Example]+ Example 16 | Find the $n$th term
>a) What is the seventh term in the geometric sequence $6$, $-30$, $150$,…?
>	$r=\frac{150}{-3}=\frac{-30}{6}=-5$
>	$t_{n}=t_{1}r^{n-1}$
>	$t_{7}=6\times (-5)^{7-1}$
>	$=93750$
>	Hence, the seventh term is $93750$
>b) Find the sixth term of the GP $3$, $4.5$, $6.75$,…
>	$a=3$, $r=\frac{4.5}{3}=1.5$, $n=6$
>	The sixth term is $22.78125$

>[!example]+ Example 17 | Does $x$ belong to
>Does $-32768$ belong to the geometric sequence $1$, $-2$, $4$, $-8$,…?
>$t_{1}=1$, $r=-2$
>$t_{n}=t_{1}r^{n-1}$
>$-32768=1\times (-2)^{n-1}$
>$(-2)^{n-1}=-32768$
>$2^{15}=32768$
>$1\times (-2)^{16-1}=(-2)^{15}=-32768$
>$-32768$ is the 16th term of this geometric sequence.

>[!example]+ Example 18 | What is the $n$th term

> You can also do this using the following shortcut: $t_{10}=t_{6}\times r^{4}=t_{6}\times (t_{6}÷t_{2})=448\times 448÷29=7168$

>[!Example]+ Consider the following…
>Consider the sequence $8, 4, 2, 1, \frac{1}{2}$
>a) Show that the sequnce is geometric.
>	$\frac{4}{8}=\frac{1}{2}$
>	$\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{2}$
>	$\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{2}$
>	$\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{2}=\frac{1}{2}$
>	Consecutive terms have a common ratio of $\frac{1}{2}$.
>	$\therefore$ the sequence is geometric with $t_{1}=8$ and $r=\frac{1}{2}$
>b) Find the general term $t_{n}$.
>	$t_{n}=t_{1}r^{n-1}$
>	$\therefore t_{n}=8(\frac{1}{2})^{n-1}$
>c) Hence, find the 12th term as a fraction.
>	$t_{12}=8\times (1/2)^{11}$
>	$=\frac{1}{256}$

>[!Example]+
>Show that the sequence $8, 4\sqrt{2}, 4, 2\sqrt{2},...$ is geometric. Hence, show that the general term of the sequence is $t_{n}=2^{\frac{\frac{7}{2}-1}{2}n}$.
>$\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{8}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
>$r=\sqrt{2}/2$
>$t_{n}=8\times\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}^{n-10}$
>$=2^{3}\times 2^{-n-1}\times 2^{\frac{1}{2}n-1}$
>$2^{\frac{7}{2}-\frac{n}{2}}$

>[!Example]+
>$k-1, 2k$ and $21-k$ are consecutive terms of a geometic sequence. Find $k$.
>Since the terms are geometric, $\frac{2k}{k-1}=\frac{21-k}{2k}$
>$\therefore 4k^{2}=(21-k)(k-1)$
>$\therefore 4k^{2}=21k-21-k^2+k$
>$\therefore 5k^{2}-22k+21=0$
>$\therefore (5k-7)(k-3)=0$
>$\therefore k=\frac{7}{5} or 3$

>[!Example]+
>A geometric sequence has $t_{2}=-6$ and $t_{5}=162$. Find its general term.
>$t_{2}=t_{1}r=-6$    (1)
>$t_{5}=t_{1}r^{4}=162$    (2)
>$\frac{t_{1}r^{4}}{t_{1}r}=\frac{162}{-6}$    {(2)÷(1)}
>$\therefore r^{3}=-27$
>$\therefore r=\sqrt[3]{-27}$
>$\therefore r=-3$
>Using (1),
>$t_{1}(-3)=-6$
>$\therefore t_{1}=2$
>Thus $t_{n}=2\times (-3)^{n-1}$

>[!Example]+
>The  green tree frog population has been growing at a constant rate of 2.5% p.a. in the local rainforest. The current population is 360 frogs.
>a) What was the population 5 years ago?
>	$t_{n}=rt_{n-1}$
>	$t_{n-1}=t_{n}/r$ (1)

>	$t_{n-2}=\frac{t_{n-1}}{r}$ (2)
