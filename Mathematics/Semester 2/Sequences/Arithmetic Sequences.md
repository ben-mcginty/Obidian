The sequence that goes up or down by the same amount from one term to another , it is called an Arithmetic sequence
The arithmetic sequence has a common difference (represented as $d$), and it is the difference between successive terms.
$d=t_{n}-t_{n-1}=t_{n+1}-t_{n}$
Arithmetic sequences can be defined recursively as:
$t_{n+1}=t_{n}+d$

>$t_{4}=t_{3}=10-5=5$
>$\therefore d=$, no common differential
>c)
>$1, 1+\sqrt{5}, 1+2\sqrt{5}, 1+3\sqrt{5}...$
>$t_{2}-t_{1}=(1+\sqrt{5})-(1)=\sqrt{5}$

>$t_{4}-t_{3}=(1+3\sqrt{5})-(1+2\sqrt{5})=\sqrt{5}$
>$\therefore d=\sqrt{5}$

>c)
>$\sqrt{50}, \sqrt{98}, \sqrt{162}, \sqrt{242}...$
>$t_{2}-t_{1}=\sqrt{98}-\sqrt{50}$

The simplest kind of sequence is one that goes up (or down) by the same amount from one term to the next. Sequences of this type are called arithmetic progressions or arithmetic sequences.

>An **arithmetic progression** (**AP**) has a **commom difference** $d$. It is the difference between sucessive terms, written as $d=t_{n}-t_{n-1}$ or $d=t_{n+1}-t_{n}$.
>An AP can be defined recursively as $t_{n+1}=t_{n}+d$.

For the sequence 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, â€¦ we can write each term as the previous term plus a common difference.
$t_{1}=3$
$t_{2}=3+4$
$t_{3}=3+4+4=3+2*4$
$t_{4}=3+4+4+4=3+3*4$
We can clearly see the pattern $t_{n}=3+(n-1)*4$
For any AP with common difference $d$,
$t_{2}=t_{1}+d$
$t_{3}=t_{2}+d=(t_{1}+d)+d=t_{1}+2d$
$t_{4}=t_{3}+d=(t_{1}+2d)+d=t_{1}+3d$
This gives us a rule for the general term $t_{n}$ of an arithmetic sequence.
$t_{n}=t_{1}+(n-1)d$

>[!important]+
>An arithemtic progresssion (AP) with common difference $d=t_{n}-t_{n-1}$ may be written as $t_{1}, t_{1}+d, t_{1}+2d, t_{1}+3d,...,t_{1}+(n-1)d$
>The **general term** $t_{n}$ of an AP is $t_{n}=t_{1}+(n-1)d$.
>The first term can aslo be written as $a$.
