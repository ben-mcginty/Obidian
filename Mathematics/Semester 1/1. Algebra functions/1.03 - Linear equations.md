- An equation is a mathematical sentence which contains an equals sign with an expression on both sides. The simplest kind of equation is a linear equation in one variable.
- The terms in a linear equation are either constants or simple variable terms with a constant. That is, any variables have only a power of 1. A value that makes an equation true is called a root or solution of the equation. 
- To solve a linear equation, rearrange it using inverse operations to isolate the variable. 
- Whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do the same to the other side of the equation.
- If there are brackets in an equation, get rid of them by expanding.
- If there are fractions, get rid of them by multiplying both sides of the equation by the lowest common denominator.

- A formula is also an equation. You can rearrange a formula to isolate a particular variable. This is called making the variable the subject. You use inverse operations to do this in a similar way to solving linear equations.
