-  A binomial product has two binomial expressions multiplied together. When they are expanded they produce an expression with three terms such as $x^2 + 2x − 3$. This is called a quadratic (trinomial) expression. Factorising a trinomial (usually) gives a binomial product. A monic quadratic is one where the coefficient of $x^2$ is 1. When the coefficient of x$^2$ is 1, we can factorise the quadratic using a special property. 
- The coefficient of x is the sum of the numbers in the brackets and the constant is given by the product of these two numbers. 
- If you recognise a perfect square or a difference of squares, you should use it as a short cut to factorise a quadratic.
- When the coefficient of $x^{2}$ is not 1, for example in the expression $5x^{2} − 10x − 4$, we need to use a different method to factorise the quadratic.
- You can use the cross method or the fraction method to factorise quadratics of the form $ax^{2} + bx + c$.
- You use these steps for the cross method.
	- identify all of the factors of $ax^{2}$ and of $c$
	- choose a pair of factors, from each, as a combination to test out
	- find the ‘cross’ product of the pairs
	- add the products to find which pair gives the middle term, bx
- The factors that give the correct middle term are your answer
- The fraction method is now used more because you don’t have to guess. The fraction method steps are as follows:
	- $\frac{(ax...)(ax...)}{a}$
	- find the product of $a$ and $c$
	- identify which factors of $a$ and $c$ generate $b$ when added
	- place the identified factors into the fraction, one in each bracket
	- cancel to get the answer (The denominator will always cancel completely)

- The other main method of factorisation of non-monic quadratics is called the PSF method. It is also called the ac method, the grouping method or the decomposition method. This method involves finding the product, sum and factors as we did in the fraction method, but after decomposing the middle term, you need to factorise in pairs. This method uses the same principles as the fraction method
- In the quadratic expression, ax$^2$ + bx + c, if there are no factors of the product of a and c that will add to give the middle coefficient b, then the quadratic expression will not factorise.
- Your teacher may prefer a particular method of quadratic factorisation.
