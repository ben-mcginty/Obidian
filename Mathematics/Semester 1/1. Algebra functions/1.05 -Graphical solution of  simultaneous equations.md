- Linear equations may involve more than one variable. To solve equations with more than one variable, more than one equation is needed.
- Simultaneous equations are sets of equations with more than one variable. Values that make all the equations true are called simultaneous solutions.
- You can solve simultaneous linear equations in two variables by graphing the equations. The point of intersection of the graphs is the solution. The graphs of two linear equations can intersect only once, and so they can have only one simultaneous solution.
