- You have seen that even though it is possible to solve simultaneous equations graphically, the process can be tedious and lack accuracy. You can solve simultaneous equations using algebraic methods.
- The elimination method adds the equations.
- Steps for the elimination method
	- Choose which variable to eliminate.
	- Make the coefficients of that variable the same size, but opposite in sign, by multiplying by suitable numbers.
	- Add the equations to eliminate the variable.
	- Solve the new equation. 
	- Substitute the solution into either of the original equations and solve for the other variable or repeat the elimination method for the other variable.
	- Check the values in both of the original equations.

- It may be necessary to simplify equations first. Get rid of fractions and brackets before you start. You need to collect all variables on the left-hand side and the constant on the right-hand side of each equation
- The other method is called the substitution method. You substitute an expression from one equation into the other. You need to arrange one of the equations so that one of the variables is the subject.
- Steps for the substitution method
	1. Use one equation to work out a formula for one variable.
	2. Substitute the formula for the variable into the other equation.
	3. Solve the new equation
	4. Substitute the solution into the formula or one of the original equations.
	5. Check the values in both of the original equations.

- Use whichever method or combination is best for a particular problem. If the equations have a variable with a coefficient of 1, the substitution method may be easier. If one variable has a fractional coefficient, the elimination method is usually easier.
- You can use a CAS calculator to solve simultaneous equations. You do not need to change the equations in any way
