**Linear relationships**

- The power of any variable in a linear relationship is one. A linear relationship involving one or two variables can be plotted on the Cartesian plane and will give a straight line graph.
- When you draw the graph of a linear relationship involving only one variable you will get a horizontal or vertical line. The graphs of $y=3$ and $x=1$ are shown below.

	- All other straight lines are generated by a linear relationship involving two variables. You can write these in the form $y = mx + c$. When you write the equation like this, the value of y depends upon the value of x, so you call y the dependent variable and x the independent variable. 
	- In the graph below, the equation $2x − 3y − 6 = 0$ is written in the general form. You could rearrange the equation of this line to $y=\frac{2}{3}x-2$

- For quantities x and y in direct proportion, as x increases or decreases y increases or decreases in the same ratio.
- The graph of quantities in direct proportion is a straight line through the origin, so it is a linear relationship. The equation is of the form y = kx, where k is a constant.
- When you compare y = mx + c to y = kx, you can see that direct proportion is a linear relationship with c = 0.
