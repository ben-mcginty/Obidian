- In Chapter 1 you looked at direct proportion and completed some practical work on graphs of straight lines. In this section you will continue to revise linear functions and their properties.
- The distance between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by $d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$

- You can use the distance, midpoint and gradient formulas to solve problems and to explore geometry and properties of shapes.
- You may have noticed that a gradient can be either positive or negative.
- The Greek letter ∆ is used to show changes in variables.
- The gradient of a straight line is given by $m=\frac{rise}{run}=\frac{∆y}{∆x}$ where ∆y is the change in y values and ∆x is the change in x values.
- A line increasing in height from left to right has a positive gradient.
- A line decreasing in height from left to right has a negative gradient.
- In the next section you will look at different ways of writing the equation of a linear function. The simplest of these is the form $y = mx + c$.
- A linear function with the equation y = mx + c. has a gradient of m and a y-intercept of c
- If two lines are parallel, then they have the same gradient. That is, $m_1=m_2$
- If two lines with gradients $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively are perpendicular, then
	- $m_{1}m_{2}=-1$
	- thus, $m_{2}=-\frac{1}{m_{1}}$
- Parallel and perpendicular lines have closely related equations.
- Parallel lines can have their equations written so only the constant term differs. For example, $2x + 3y – 5 = 0$ and $2x + 3y +1 = 0$ are parallel. They both have gradient $\frac{–2}{3}$
- Perpendicular lines can have their equations written as $ax + by + c_1 = 0$ and $bx – ay + c_2 = 0$
- For example, $2x + 3y = 5$ and $6x – 4y + 7 = 0$ are perpendicular as they can be written as $2x+3y–5=0$ and $3x–2y+3 \frac{1}{2}= 0$ Their gradients are $\frac{-2}{3m}$ and $\frac{3}{2}$.
