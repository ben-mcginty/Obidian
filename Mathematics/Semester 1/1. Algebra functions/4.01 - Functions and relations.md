- Many mathematical rules can be expressed as relationships between variables. You have seen many of these already. A relation is the most general kind of relationship between variables. You often write a relation or function as y = R(x) or y = f(x). The first variable in the ordered pair (x, y) is used to work out the value of the second according to a rule. In this case, the second variable depends on the first one
	- A relation R is a set of ordered pairs (x, y), where x ∈ X and y ∈ Y. X and Y are often both the set of real numbers. The first element of an ordered pair (x, y) in a relation is called the independent variable and the second element, y, is called the dependent variable.
	- You can show that an ordered pair belongs to a relation R by writing (x, y) ∈ R or y = R(x).
	- The set of values of the independent variable x is called the domain and is often the set X.
	- The set Y often includes values that are not in the ordered pairs and is called the codomain. The set of values of the dependent variable y is called the range.
- Most of the relations you study in mathematics are ordered pairs of numbers and many are shown by a rule such as $y=x^{2}-3$ or $\frac{x^2}{4}+\frac{y^2}{9}=1$
- The second rule could be written as $y=\pm \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{4-x^2}$
- You can also show a relation with a mapping. The diagram below shows the mapping of the ordered pairs (4, 2), (4, 4), (10, 2), (10, 5), (12, 2), (12, 3) and (12, 4).![[Pasted image 20220607114952.png]]
- The sets X = {4, 10, 12} and Y are sets of natural numbers. The domain is {4, 10, 12}, the codomain could be the natural numbers and the range is {2, 3, 4, 5}.
- Relations are also shown as graphs on the Cartesian plane. When drawing a graph from a rule, you usually choose values of x to substitute into an equation. These values are independent since you could choose any value. The y values depend on what we have chosen for x.
- The mapping below shows another relation.![[Pasted image 20220607115021.png]]
- In the second example, the domain is {A, B, C, D and E} and the range is {1, 2, 3, 4}.
- To find the domain and range of numeric relations, you look for real numbers that will fit the rule. For example, for y = x2 – 3, you could substitute any real number for x. So the domain is the set of all real numbers
- Since $x^{2}\geq0$ for all real $x,x^2-3\geq-3$
- Since $y=x^2-3$, the range is ${y:g\geq-3}$.
- You have already studied functions in previous years. All functions have the rule that each x value gives only one value for the dependent variable y
- In Example 1, parts b and c are functions, but a is not since x = 2 has two values for y. However, a function can have more than one y value. In Example 1 part c, the pairs (2, 1) and (–2, 1) both have the same y value, but different x values.
- There is a simple test that shows if a graph is a function.![[Pasted image 20220607115225.png]]
- Some functions are not defined for all values of x, so a vertical line might not cut the graph at all. To be a function, a vertical line cannot cut the graph more than once.
- Most graphs that you sketch are functions of continuous variables, where x can be any value. Some have discrete variables where the x values go in steps such as 1, 2, 3 … and are called functions of a discrete variable.
- A discontinuous function has a break in the line of its graph.
- The function has a discontinuity at the break. You would have to lift your pencil off the paper when you draw the graph.
- The hyperbola below is an example of a discontinuous function![[Pasted image 20220607115414.png]]
- The vertical line x = a is called a vertical asymptote. It is a line that the curve approaches as x gets close to a, but never reaches it. Many graphs have vertical asymptotes at discontinuities. 
- There are other types of discontinuous functions such as the step graph below.![[Pasted image 20220607115435.png]]
- Remember that an open circle means that the point at that end of the line is not included, but a closed circle means the point is included.
- Even though there is a y value for every x value on the graph, there are discontinuities where the graph jumps from one line to another.
