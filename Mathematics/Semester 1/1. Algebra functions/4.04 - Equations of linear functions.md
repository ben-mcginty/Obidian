You have already looked at the equation $y=mx +c$.
The equation $y = mx + c$ is called the gradient–intercept form of a linear function.
It is a continuous function with domain and range the real numbers. Its graph is a straight line.
$ax + by + c = 0$ is the standard form (or general form) of a linear function. When expressed like this, the equation is changed so that rational constants are integers and all terms are on the LHS with a positive coefficient of x

You can draw the graph of a linear function by finding its intercepts.
An x-intercept is the point where the graph of a function crosses the x-axis of the Cartesian plane. This is a value of x that makes the function zero (y = 0). An x-intercept is also called a zero
A y-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis. It is the value of the function when x = 0
Intercepts are also the distances from the origin to the point where the graph meets the axes.

You can find the equation of a linear function given certain information
Given a point $(x_1, y_1)$ on the line with gradient $m$ and letting $P = (x, y)$, the line AP has the gradient
	$m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$
	$m=\frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}$
thus, $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$
The gradient–point form is $y – y_1 = m(x – x_1)$, where $m$ is the gradient and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line.
The intercept form is $\frac{x}{a}+\frac{y}{b}=1$, where $a$ and $b$ are the $x-$ and $y-$ intercepts respectively.
The two-point form is $\frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$ or $\frac{y-y_1}{y_2-y_1}=\frac{x-x_1}{x_2-x_1}$
where $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ are points on the line.
If $a = 0$ or $b = 0$, the equation $ax + by + c = 0$ becomes a vertical or horizontal line.
Horizontal and vertical lines
- $x= a$ is a vertical line with x-intercept $a$. It is not a function, but a relation with domain ${x: x = a}$ and range ${y: y ∈ R}$. Its gradient is undefined.
- $y= b$ is a horizontal line with y-intercept b. It is a function with domain ${x: x ∈ R}$ and range ${y: y = b}.$ It has a zero gradient.
