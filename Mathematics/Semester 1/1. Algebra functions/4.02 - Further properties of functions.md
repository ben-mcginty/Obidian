- We usually write functions of single variables using the notation f(x) or y = f(x). You could write f(x) = 4x3 – 5, g(x) = 2x + 3 to define the functions f and g in terms of the variable x. g(–6) would mean the value of g when –6 is substituted for the variable x.
- For the family of functions y = cf(x) as c varies, the function stretches or shrinks vertically. This is called (vertical) dilation. If c > 1, it is stretched vertically so that it looks thinner and if c < 1 it is compressed vertically so that it looks fatter.![[Pasted image 20220607115554.png]]
- Horizontal dilation occurs with functions y = f(dx). If d > 1, it compresses horizontally and if d < 1 it expands horizontally.![[Pasted image 20220607115608.png]]
- The graph of y = f(–x) is a reflection of y = f(x) in the y-axis.![[Pasted image 20220607115620.png]]
- The graph of y = –f(x) is a reflection of y = f(x) in the x-axis.![[Pasted image 20220607115825.png]]
- **Even and odd functions**
- If f(–x) = f(x) for all real values of x, the function is even. An even function has line symmetry with the y-axis as the axis of symmetry.

- If f(–x) = –f(x) for all real values of x, the function is odd. An odd function has rotational symmetry, with the origin (0, 0) as the point of symmetry.
