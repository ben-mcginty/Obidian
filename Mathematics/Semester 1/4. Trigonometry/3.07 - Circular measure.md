Angles in triangles are normally measured in degrees.
Circular measure uses radians to measure angles instead of degrees. Radians are easier to use with circles, trigonometric graphs and calculus, which you will study later in this course.
One radian ($1^{c}$ or 1 rad) is the angle at the centre of a circle produced by an arc that is equal in length to the radius of the circle. While the symbol ° shows degrees, it is not necessary to use the symbol $^{c}$  for radians.

Since the circumference of a circle is $2πr$, one complete revolution in radians is $2π^{c}$, so $2π^{c} = 360°$ and $π^c = 180°$. You can use this for conversions.

You can find trigonometric ratios on your calculator when angles are in radians by changing the mode from degrees to radians. For example, $\cos{0.7^{c}} = 0.764 842 18728...$
You can also find exact ratios from the special triangles that you investigated earlier in the chapter, using radians rather than degrees.

It is better to use the rationalised forms of the exact values ( $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$ ) than those with the square roots in the denominator.

The ASTC rule for angles in degrees works the same way for radians.
