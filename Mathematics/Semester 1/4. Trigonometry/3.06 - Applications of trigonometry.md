You have already seen some applications of trigonometry in this chapter, including angles of elevation, angles of depression and bearings. This section continues with more applications, using a mixture of right- and non-right-angled triangles.

You may sometimes need a mixture of rules to solve a problem.
- When given a right-angled triangle, use simple trig ratios rather than the sine and cosine rules.
- Use the sine rule when you are given 2 sides and an opposite angle, or 2 angles and a side.
- Use the cosine rule when you are given 2 sides and the included angle, or three sides (that donâ€™t make a Pythagorean triple) and need to find an angle.
- If there is more than one triangle, you may need to find the common side by using the triangle you know the most about first.

Sometimes you can use trigonometry for 3-dimensional problems.
