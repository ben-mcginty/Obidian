In Chapter 3 you solved trigonometric equations when finding an angle in a right-angled triangle. For example, sin (θ) = 0.64 gives a solution of θ ≈ 40°. But with extended angles, there are actually other solutions, such as θ = 140°, 400° and 500°. Check with your calculator to see that the sine of these other angles is 0.64.
You can solve trigonometric equations by looking at their graphs.

Notice in Example 16 a that the two solutions to $\tan{x}=1$ in the domain $0 ≤ x ≤ 2π$ are $x = \frac{π}{4}, \frac{5π}{4}$ . These angles are in the first and third quadrants where $\tan{x}>0$. The ASTC rule can help solve trig equations.
Trig functions of the angles of the form $(\frac{n\pi}{2}\pm x)$ for odd $n$ simplify to give the co-ratio, but functions of angles of the form $(nπ + x)$ simplify to give the same ratio.
This means that you can simplify an angle of any size to the same ratio of an acute angle by expressing it as the sum or difference of an acute angle and a multiple of $π(180°)$. You work out the sign from the ASTC rule for the original angle.

Some equations need simplifying or the domain extended in order to solve them.
