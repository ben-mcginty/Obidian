The sine rule is used to find unknown sides or angles in non-right-angled triangles.
You can demonstrate the sine rule by drawing a right-angled triangle inside a non-right-angled triangle.
From $\Delta CAD$, $\sin{A}=\frac{h}{b}$
So $h=b\sin{A}$
From $\Delta CBD$, $\sin{B}=\frac{h}{a}$
So $h=a\sin{B}$
Combining $h = b \sin{A}$ and $h = a \sin{B}$ gives $b\sin{A} = a\sin{B}$
This gives $\frac{a}{\sin{A}}=\frac{b}{\sin{B}}$
Starting with the altitude BD instead of CD gives $\frac{a}{\sin{A}}=\frac{c}{\sin{C}}$.
A full proof of the sine rule has to show that it is also true for obtuse-angled triangles.
You can use the sine rule to find an unknown side in a non-right angled triangle when you know another side and two angles.

Thus, $\frac{a}{\sin{A}}=\frac{b}{\sin{B}}=\frac{c}{\sin{C}}$ or $\frac{\sin{A}}{a}=\frac{\sin{B}}{b}=\frac{\sin{C}}{c}$
You can also use the sine rule to find an unknown angle in a non-right-angled triangle when you know another angle and two sides.
Since $\sin{θ}=\sin{180°–θ}$, there are sometimes two possible answers when finding the angle using the sine rule. Your calculator will give the acute angle, but it could also be obtuse, depending on the shape of the triangle.
You can use the sine rule to solve problems.
