The angles and their opposite sides in a non-right-angled triangle are named using the same letters. Upper case letters are used for the angles and lower case ones are used for the sides.

You can use trigonometry to find the area of a triangle when you do not know its height.
In $âˆ†BCD$
$\sin{C}=\frac{h}{a}$
$h=a \sin{C}$
Area $=\frac{1}{2}bh$
$=\frac{1}{2}b(a \sin{C})$
$=\frac{1}{2}ab\sin{C}$

Other forms of the area formula are
$A=\frac{1}{2}bc\sin{A}$
$A=\frac{1}{2}ac\sin{B}$
You can find the area of other figures by using the triangle area formula.
