You may have already noticed that sin(30°) is exactly a half. There are other angles that have exact trigonometric ratios.

By measuring angles around a circle, you can find trigonometric ratios for any angles, not just angles less than 90°. Remember that in mathematics, angles turn anticlockwise.

As x and y values become negative in different quadrants, sin (θ), cos (θ) and tan (θ) will become negative.

Putting this information together gives the general rules for the angles of any magnitude.

This is called the ASTC rule and you can learn it by making up a phrase that has these letters in it. For example, ‘All stations to Central’ or ‘All students to class’
- A stands for ‘all’, which means that all trig ratios are positive in the first quadrant
- S stands for sine, which means that only sin (θ) is positive in the second quadrant and the others are negative.
- T stands for tangent, which means that only tan (θ) is positive in the third quadrant and the others are negative.
- C stands for cosine, which means that only cos (θ) is positive in the fourth quadrant and the others are negative.
You can find trigonometric ratios of angles greater than 360° by going around the circle more than once.
Angles that turn in the opposite direction (clockwise from the x-axis) are negative.
