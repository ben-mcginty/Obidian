There are some trigonometric identities that can be used to simplify or evaluate expressions. In Chapter 3 you saw that in the unit circle, $\sin{\theta} = y$, $\cos{\theta} = x$ and $\tan{θ} = \frac{y}{x}$
This gives the trigonometric identity $\tan{\theta}=\frac{\sin{\theta}}{\cos{\theta}}$ by substituting $\sin{\theta}$ for $y$ and $\cos{\theta}$ for $x$.
In Chapter 4 you saw that the equation of a circle with centre $(0, 0)$ and radius 1 unit is given by $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. This gives the trigonometric identity $\cos{\theta}^{2}+\sin{\theta}^{2}=1$.
In $\bigtriangleup OAB$, $∠OBA$ = $/\frac{pi}{2}-\theta$ (angle sum of a triangle is $2π$)
- $\sin{\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta}=\frac{x}{1}=\cos{\theta}$
- $\cos{\frac{pi}{2}-\theta}=y=\sin{\theta}$
You will need to use some of these trigonometric identities in this section.

In this section you will look at other trigonometric identities that come from the unit circle.

If you prefer, you can type sin, cos and tan on your CAS calculator instead of accessing the functions.
In Chapter 3 you found exact ratios for angles of $\frac{\pi}{6}$, $\frac{\pi}{4}$ and $\frac{\pi}{3}$. Now you can use sums and differences of angles to find exact ratios of other angles.
Multiples of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ can be written in terms of these special angles. For example:
$\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{\pi}{6}=\frac{3\pi}{12}-\frac{2\pi}{12}=\frac{\pi}{12}$
$\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{\pi}{6}=\frac{3\pi}{12}-\frac{2\pi}{12}=\frac{5\pi}{12}$
$\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{\pi}{3}=\frac{3\pi}{12}-\frac{4\pi}{12}=\frac{7\pi}{12}$
You may wish to use your CAS calculator to investigate what other angles have trigonometric ratios that can be expressed exactly.
You can use the sums and differences of angles to find other identities.
