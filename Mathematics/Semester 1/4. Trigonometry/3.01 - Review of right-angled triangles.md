In this section you will revise the work you have done previously on right-angled triangles using the basic trigonometric ratios
Angles are measured in degrees in this section. Later on in this chapter, you will look at a different way to measure angles.
Angles can be whole degrees, such as 39°, or include decimals, for example, 56.3°, or in degrees and minutes, such as 78°12'. Calculators use seconds as well, but these are too small to be significant in this course.
Scientific and CAS calculators usually convert between decimals and degrees and minutes, or you can use the fact that a minute is $\frac{1}{60}^{th}$ of a degree
For example, to change 56.3° into degrees and minutes, you use $56\frac{3}{10} = 56\frac{18}{60}$ to get 56°18'
To change 78°12' into a decimal, use $78 {12}{60}$ and divide 12 by 60 to get 0.2.
So 78°12' = 78.2°.
You should remember the trigonometric definitions shown below.

You should state solutions to the same accuracy as figures given in the question unless asked to do otherwise.

Notice in Example 1 that when the unknown side was on the top of the ratio, you multiplied the known side by the trigonometric ratio. When it was on the bottom, you divided the known side by the trigonometric ratio. You can use trigonometry to solve problems such as finding the height of objects that you cannot measure directly.

You can apply trigonometry to problems using bearings. Bearings can be described in different ways.
