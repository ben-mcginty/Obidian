In this section you will look at some examples where trigonometry can model periodic situations such as tides, temperatures over the seasons and a pendulum
If you recognise that a graph has periodic data, you can measure its amplitude and period and in some cases find its equation.

When a graph looks periodic, you can find a model for its equation by using the skills you learned earlier in this chapter and checking the model on a CAS calculator.
When you know the equation, you can use it to find out extra information.
