In this section you will look at how $f(x + c)$ changes $f(x)$ in trig functions.

The phase shift of $y = \cos{x}$ relative to $y = \sin{x}$ is $\frac{\pi}{2}$, as $\cos{x}=\sin{(x+(\frac{\pi}{2}))}$
$\cos{x}$ is $\frac{\pi}{2}$ 'ahead' of $\sin{x}$
The phase shift of $\sin{x}$ relative to $\cos{x}$ is $- \frac{\pi}{2}$, as $\sin{x}=\cos{x-\frac{\pi}{2}}$, $\sin{x}$ is $\frac{\pi}{2}$ 'behind' $\cos{x}$.
You can put together the phase changes with the amplitude and period that you learnt in the previous sections.
