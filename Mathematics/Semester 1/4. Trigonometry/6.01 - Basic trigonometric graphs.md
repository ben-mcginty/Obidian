In Chapter 3 you were introduced to circular measure and radians. You used the unit circle (circle with radius 1 unit) to find exact values of angles within the 4 quadrants.
In this chapter, you will look at the unit circle more closely and use it to help draw the graphs of the trigonometric functions $y = \sin{x}$, $y = \cos{x}$ and $y = \tan{x}$.
While you can draw graphs using degrees along the x-axis, it is more meaningful to use radians. Since radians are ratios of measures around the circumference of a circle, they represent real numbers. For example, $π$ is approximately $3.14$, $\frac{\pi}{6}$ is about $0.52$ and so on.

You can use the exact ratios for multiples of $\frac{π}{6}$ and the ratios of 0, $\frac{π}{2}$ , π, $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ and 2π to draw the graphs of trigonometric functions.
Since $\sin{θ} = y$, take the $y$ values around the unit circle and plot them for $\sin{\theta}$ on a graph as shown in the diagram.

The graph of $y = \sin{x}$ fits the ASTC rule as values of $\sin{x}$ are positive in the first and second quadrants (above the x-axis) and negative in the third and fourth quadrants (below the x-axis).
Since $\cos{θ}=x$, take the x values around the unit circle and plot them for $\cos{θ}$ on a graph as shown in the diagram. The x values are horizontal lines so they will not line up directly with y values. You will need to measure the horizontal lines and then plot them on the graph as vertical lines

The graph of y = cos (x) fits the ASTC rule as values of cos (x) are positive in the first and fourth quadrants and negative in the second and third quadrants.

The graph of y = cos (x) fits the ASTC rule as values of cos (x) are positive in the first and fourth quadrants and negative in the second and third quadrants.
Notice that OA = 1 (radius) and using similar triangles OMP and OAT:
$\frac{y}{x}=\frac{AT}{1}=AT$
This means tan (θ) = AT = the length of the tangent cut off by the radius extending to touch the tangent. This is why this ratio is called the tangent.
This happens in all four quadrants. The radius is extended to meet the tangent in each case.

Notice on the circle that the radii at $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ do not meet the tangent, so $\tan{\frac{\pi}{2}}$ and $\tan{\frac{3\pi}{2}}$ are undefined. These angles occur at points $(0, 1)$ and $(0, –1)$.
Using $tan (θ) = \frac{y}{x}$ gives $\tan{\frac{\pi}{2}}=\frac{1}{0}$ which is undefined and $\tan{\frac{3\pi}{2}}=\frac{-1}{0}$ which is also undefined.
This means there are asymptotes at these points on the graph of $y = \tan{x}$.
The graph of $y = \tan{x}$ fits the ASTC rule as values of tan x are positive in the first and third quadrants and negative in the second and fourth quadrants.
Remember that angles can be greater than $2π$ and they can be negative. These values of trigonometric functions repeat, for example,
$\sin{\frac{\pi}{3}}=\sin{2\pi+\frac{\pi}{3}}=\sin{4\pi+\frac{\pi}{3}}=\sin{-2\pi+\frac{\pi}{3}}...$

The period of a function $f(x)$ is the smallest value of $t$ such that $f(x) = f(x + t)$ for all x. The section of the function from $f(x)$ to $f(x + t)$ is called a cycle. Functions with a period are called periodic functions.
The amplitude of a periodic function is half the vertical distance between the maximum and minimum values. It is the distance from the centre to the extreme values.
- The period of $y = \sin{x}$ is $2π$ and its amplitude is $1$
- The period of $y = \cos{x}$ is $2π$ and its amplitude is $1$
- The period of $y = \tan{x}$ is $π$ and it has no amplitude.

Once you know the basic shape of the trigonometric functions, you can use translations and dilations to draw similar functions.
