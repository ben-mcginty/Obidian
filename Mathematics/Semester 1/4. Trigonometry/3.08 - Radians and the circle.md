When radians are used, finding the length of an arc in a circle is simple.
Compare the ratios of arc length to circumference, and angle size to angle of revolution.
$\frac{arc-lengh-(l)}{circumfracne-(c)}=\frac{angle(\theta)}{angle-of-revolution}$
$\frac{l}{2\pi r}=\frac{\theta}{2\pi}$
This gives $l=r\theta$
The length of an arc l that subtends an angle of $θ$ at the centre of a circle, radius $r$, is given by $l = rθ$.

Comparing the ratios of an area of a sector and the angle it makes inside the circle gives:
$\frac{area-of-sector-A}{area-of-circle}=\frac{angle - \theta}{angle-of-revolution}$
$\frac{AoS}{\pi r^{2}}=\frac{\theta}{2\pi}$
This gives $A=\frac{1}{2}r^{2}\theta$
The area of a sector $A$ that subtends an angle of $θ$ at the centre of a circle, radius $r$, is given by $A=\frac{1}{2}r^{2}\theta$

You can use the formulas for arc length and area of a sector to solve circle problems.

When you have to use intermediate values in calculations, keep the full values stored in your calculator memories and use these in the calculations. You should round answers, not the intermediate values used to find an answer
