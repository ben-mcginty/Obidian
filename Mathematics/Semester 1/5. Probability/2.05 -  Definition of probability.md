The mathematical definition of probability has been chosen to make it useful for working out the likelihood of something occurring. Different mathematicians have worked out different definitions and sets of rules, but they are really very much the same. The definition below is a simplified version of these mathematical definitions.

The probability of an event A in a sample space S is a real number P(A) such that
1. 0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1
2. $P(S) = 1$ and $P( ) = 0$
3. The probability of a union of disjoint events is the sum of the probabilities of the events.

They are the rules that apply to sample spaces like the total of two dice. In that case, the elements are the different ways that the dice can fall, and every element has the same probability. Of course, if one of the dice were biased, then the elements could have different probabilities rather than being all the same. This is one of the reasons that mathematicians have defined probability like this.
The third property of probability means that probability has to add sensibly. The probability of an event made by combining separate (disjoint) events has to be the total of the probabilities of the separate events. In Year 10 you used the number of items in a finite sample space to work out the probability of an event. This easily satisfies the definition.

What about probabilities involving areas?
You usually assume that the probability of ‘hitting’ a particular area in a 2D problem is proportional to the area, and this satisfies the mathematical requirements for probability. However, the probability of hitting a single point in an infinite sample space is usually zero, otherwise the total probability of all the points would be more than 1.
