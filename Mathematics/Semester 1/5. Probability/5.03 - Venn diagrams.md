Venn diagrams are very useful for events that have some elements in common in a sample space. This is particularly the case for situations where the elements can be classified according to different characteristics.
A Venn diagram shows sets or events as closed shapes (usually circles or ellipses) with intersections shown as overlapping. The circles or ellipses are enclosed by a rectangle representing the universal set (sample space).

Venn diagrams are even more useful in situations with three overlapping events in a sample space.
