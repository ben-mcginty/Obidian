Governments, businesses and other organisations such as medical research institutes collect a great deal of data. They collect the data to do better planning, to inform decisions, to guide decisions and so on. In order to make sense of the data, it is analysed in various ways. One way of doing so is to use the data to estimate the probabilities of events and to determine whether variables are likely to be dependent or independent. For example, retailers are very interested in the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, so will conduct research to determine whether their advertising expenditures produce worthwhile improvements in sales.
Example 17 is actually a simplification of the evidence obtained in a real study in the United States after a psychology professor suggested that introductory discounts would have a long-term detrimental effect on sales. The actual analysis was much more detailed, but it did validate the professor’s theory. It is interesting to speculate on the reasons for this and whether it applies to other products.

Calculations like those in Example 18 are common in medical statistics. If you don’t know the incidence of a particular condition in the population, it makes sense to compare the results of applying and not applying a particular procedure.
