In the earlier sections of this chapter, you used tree diagrams, two-way tables and Venn diagrams to find the probabilities of events in cases where other events occur as well. The events that are assumed to occur may occur simultaneously or before the event whose probability you are calculating. It is even possible that the assumed event occurs after the event whose probability you are calculating. In all these cases, where a particular event is assumed to occur and the probability of another event is calculated under this assumption, we say that the calculated probability is a conditional probability. Since this kind of calculation occurs so often, it is convenient to have a definition and notation for conditional probability

The conditional probability of an event $A$ given event $B$ is written as $P(A|B)$, and is the probability that event A occurs, assuming that event $B$ occurs. The sample space for $P(A|B)$ is restricted to $B$.

How is the probability P(A|B) related to other probabilities? Since the sample space for this is just B, only elements within B are in its sample space.

The conditional probability of A given B can be calculated using the formula $P(A|B)=\frac{P(A∩B)}{P(B)}$ .

The formula above is easily proven for finite sample spaces.
Suppose there are n + m elements in B with m of them in
A ∩ B and u elements in the universal set as shown in the diagram.

Multiplying by $P(B)$ gives the alternate form $P(A∩B)=P(A|B)P(B)$.
There are often times when the use of the formula above is much more efficient that other means of calculation.
While tree diagrams are an important probability method, you can use conditional probability to solve many problems without drawing a tree diagram.

You can use a string of conditional probabilities together. For example, the probability of getting 4 red marbles out of 4 marbles drawn from a bag containing 5 red and 5 blue ones is $P(Red|3 reds) × P(Red|2 reds) × P(Red|1 red) × P(Red) = \frac{2}{7}\times \frac{3}{8}\times \frac{4}{9}\times \frac{5}{10}=\frac{1}{42}$
The string of probabilities above may make more sense to you if you read it backwards. Then you can think of it as red, then another red after the first red, then another red after the first two reds and another red after the first 3 reds.
