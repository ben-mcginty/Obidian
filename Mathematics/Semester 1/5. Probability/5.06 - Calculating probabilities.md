In Chapter 2, you learnt the rules for counting combinations, complementary events and combining the probabilities of unions of events.

The number of combinations of r objects from n distinct objects is given by $\binom{n}{r}=^{n}C_{r}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}=\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-r+1)}{r!}$
For an event A, the probability of its complement $A'$ is given by $P(A') =1-P(A)$.
For any events A and B in a sample space, $P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A and B)$.
For mutually exclusive events, $A ∩ B$ = , i.e. $P(A and B) = 0$, so $P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)$.
The words ‘and’ and ‘or’ have specific meanings for events.
- $A$ and $B$ means the intersection, $A ∩ B$
- $A$ or $B$ means the union, $A ∪ B$
Together with the rules you have learnt in this chapter, you now have a wide set of tools for calculating probabilities.

There are other ways to do Example 15, and you should already know that $^{n}C_{1} = n$, so you would use $3 × 4$ instead of $^{3}C_{1}$ × $^{4}C_{1}$

If you work out a probability problem using different but correct methods, you will get the same answer each time.
