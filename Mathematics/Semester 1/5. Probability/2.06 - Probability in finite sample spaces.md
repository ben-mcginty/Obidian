In probability situations for finite sample spaces, the elementary outcomes often have equal probabilities. In this case, the probability of an event is determined by simply counting the number of elements in the event.
You will often see the expression ‘choose at random’. What does this mean mathematically?
If you chose a marble at random from a bag that contained 10 red marbles and 4 green marbles, every marble would have an equal probability of being chosen. This obviously does not mean that the probability of getting a red marble is the same as getting a green marble because there are different numbers of each colour.
For finite sample spaces, it is more common to use the counting notation n(E) than the set notation |E|.
If you use the sample space {2 heads, tail and head, 2 tails} with 3 elements for throwing two coins at the same time, the formula doesn’t give useful results. The sample space {HH, HT, TH, TT} with 4 elements has to be used so that the probabilities of each element are the same.
The words impossible and certain have particular meanings in probability
It is often easier to find the probability of something not occurring than to find the probability of it occurring. For example, it is easier to find the probability of getting the same number on two dice than it is to work out the probability of different numbers. ‘The same number’ and ‘different numbers’ are separate events but make the whole sample space. They are complementary events. You can use the complement of an event to find a probability.
A A ∪ = S so P(S) = P (A A ∪
But A and A' are mutually exclusive, so P A( ) ∪ = A P( ) A P + ( ) A .
This gives P A( )+ = P A( ) 1 so the property is proved.
If you take a card at random from a normal pack of cards and put it back 1000 times, how many times would you expect to get a spade? Because there are equal numbers of spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs, you would expect to get spades about 250 times. The probability of an event shows you the proportion of times the event can be expected to happen in the long run.
Of course, the expected frequency would only occur sometimes. It is more correct to say it is the average number expected. After all, if you toss a coin 50 times, you would expect 25 heads, even though you wouldn’t get this exact number particularly often.
Some finite sample spaces will not be uniform. In these cases you need to know the probabilities of the elementary outcomes to solve problems.
