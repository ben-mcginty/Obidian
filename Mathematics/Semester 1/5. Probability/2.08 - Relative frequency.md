In many practical situations, the information to set up a sample space and probabilities as described in previous sections is not available. However, there could be statistical information available that allows you to estimate the probability of a particular event.

Suppose the probability of an event is $P(E)$. If you do n experiments, you expect the frequency of the event to be $f (E) ≈ P(E) × n$. Dividing by $n$ gives $P(E) ≈ \frac{f(E)}{n}$.
A large number of trials will make things more accurate, but then you need to be careful about the way you use probabilities based on statistical information.
