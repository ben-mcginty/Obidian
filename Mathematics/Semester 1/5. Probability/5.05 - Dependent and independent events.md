In the previous section of this chapter you learned how to work out conditional probability. This is the formal mathematical method of calculating the probabilities of combined events where the occurrence of one event affects the probability of the other. Events such as these are called dependent events. The name for events that do not affect each other’s probabilities is independent events.

Two events A and B are independent if and only if $P(A|B) = P(A)$ or $P(B|A) = P(B)$.
For independent events $A$ and $B$, $P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)$.

If and only if means that the sentence works both ways. If $P(A|B) = P(A)$ and $P(B|A) = P(B)$ then the events are independent, and if the events are independent then $P(A|B) = P(A)$ and $P(B|A) = P(B)$.
In fact, if $P(A|B) = P(A)$, then $P(B|A) = P(B)$ and vice versa, as shown below.
Since $P(A ∩ B) = P(A|B) × P(B)$, if $P(A|B) = P(A)$, then substituting gives $P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)$.
Now $P(B|A) = \frac{P(A∩B)}{P(A)}$ , so substituting gives $P(B|A)=P\frac{P(A)\times P(B)}{P(A)}=P(B)$.
Thus all four conditions are equivalent: A and B are independent; $P(A|B) = P(A)$; $P(B|A) = P(B)$; and $P(A∩B)=P(A)×P(B)$ are interchangeable

Mathematically, we define dependent events as below.
- Dependent events are not independent.
- $P(A|B) ≠ P(A)$, $P(B|A) ≠ P(B)$; and $P(A ∩ B) ≠ P(A) × P(B)$.

Notice that whether events are dependent or independent, the probability of the event $A ∩ B$ can be obtained by multiplying two probabilities. In the case of dependent events you need to use conditional probability, but if the events are independent you just multiply the probabilities of the separate events. This is the same as the method used for tree diagrams.

For multiple repetitions of independent events, you can just keep multiplying the probabilities.

Some families have lots of children of the same sex over several generations. This means that you cannot always assume that the birth of boys or girls is equally likely. Probability is often used in court cases. For example, DNA evidence often is given like ‘the probability that another person left this blood behind is 1 in 150 million’

There is no basis to assume that SIDS deaths in the same family are independent of each other – medically one would immediately suspect some genetic factor. Sally Clark, an English solicitor and daughter of a policeman, was convicted in 1999 of murdering her two sons on the basis of the calculations shown in Example 14. Among others, the Royal Statistical Society objected to this blatant misuse of statistics. Her conviction was eventually overturned and she was released after having served over 3 years in prison
