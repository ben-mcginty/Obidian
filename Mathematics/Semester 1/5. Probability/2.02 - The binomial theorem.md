You should recall that the expansion of a perfect square is $(x+y)^{2}=x^{2}+2xy+y^{2}$.
What happens when you expand $(x + y)^{3}$?
Since $(x+y)^{3} = (x+y)^{2}(x+y)$, you can just multiply $(x^{2}+2xy+y^{2})$ by $(x + y)$.
This can be shown as

The coefficients for each expansion are shown in red above and are the sums of the successive coefficients of the previous expansion, apart from the 1s at either end.
The coefficients for the expansions from $(x+y)^{2}$ to $(x+y)^5$ can be set out in a triangle as shown below. Some of the additions above are also shown.
The expansions of $(x + y)^0$ and $(x + y)^1$ can be added to the top of the triangle. Remember that $a^{0 = 1}$ for any $a ≠ 0$, so $(x+y)^{0}=1$ and $(x+y)^{1}=1x + 1y$. Numbering each row by the power and putting these rows on top gives the complete triangle below.
This triangle of numbers is called Pascal’s triangle. It is constructed in exactly the same way as the coefficients in the expansions of $(x+y)^{n}$ : each number is the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it. The numbers are the coefficients of the expansion of $(x+y)^{n}$ when the expansion is written out, with decreasing powers of $x$ in each successive term. The terms in the expansion start with $x^{n}$ , then $x^{n−1}y$, then $x^{n−2}y^{2}$ , and so on until you get to $xy^{n−1}$ and finally $y^{n}$ . Notice that the powers of $x$ and $y$ in each term add up to $n.$

Expansions of the type $(x + y)^{n}$ are called binomial expansions because there are two numbers in the brackets
There is a formula for the values of the numbers in Pascal’s triangle so you don’t have to write out the values of row 15 to find the expansion of $(x+y)^{15}$

Many scientific calculators also have the nCr function.
When you put together all of the information covered so far in this section you get the following.

The binomial expansion is symmetrical with respect to x and y, so you can reverse the coefficients to get![[Pasted image 20220607210811.png]]
