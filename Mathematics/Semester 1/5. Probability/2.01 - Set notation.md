You have already used the concept of a set in junior mathematics, but it now needs to be defined more carefully. About 100 years ago it was realised that simply defining a set as a collection of objects or symbols led to contradictions. Sets are now always limited by the context and must be well-defined to avoid problems.

A well-defined collection is one in which there is no ambiguity as to whether or not an object belongs to the collection. A set is a well-defined collection of objects, usually denoted by a capital letter. Each member of a set is called an element. The elements are listed in braces such as A = {1, 3, 5, 7, …} or defined by a property like ‘a counting number not divisible by 2’. This is written formally as A = {x: x is a counting number not divisible by 2}, which is read as ‘the set A with elements x such that x is a counting number not divisible by 2’. It doesn’t matter what order you write the elements of a set in, so {a, e, i, o, u} is the same as {e, a, o, i, u}
The universal set is a fixed set of all the elements used in a particular problem, theory, context, or discussion. The universal set is shown as U or x (the Greek letter xi). The universal set could be implied by the context. In some cases it might not be formally specified but is still clearly understood.
The null set is the set with no elements, shown as {} or .
Sets are usually shown using capital letters and the symbol ∈ means ‘is a member of ’, so 11 ∈ A means 11 is a member of A and 14 ∉ A means 14 is not a member of A.

Venn diagrams are often used to show small numbers of sets and their relationships. [[5.03 - Venn diagrams]]
A Venn diagram shows sets as circles or ovals, with elements common to the two sets shown by the overlapping of the circles. The whole diagram is shown within a rectangle representing the universal set. Sometimes elements are shown within the circles.

There are a number of set operations and relationships for which you should know the symbols.

**Set relations and operations**
- Two sets are equal if every element of one is also an element of the other. Mutually exclusive sets A and B have no elements in common. They are also called disjoint sets. This diagram shows disjoint sets A and B.
- The set $A$ is a subset of the set $B$, written as $A ⊆ B$, if every element of $A$ is an element of $B$.
- A proper subset is one that is definitely smaller, thus $A ⊂ B$ means that $A$ is a subset that is not equal to $B$.
- The intersection of the sets $A$ and $B$, written as $A ∩ B$, is the set whose elements are elements of both $A$ and $B$.
- The union of the sets $A$ and $B$, written as $A ∪ B$, is the set whose elements are elements of at least one of $A$ or $B$ (are in $A$ or $B$ or both).
- The complement of the set A, written as $A′$ or $A$, is the set consisting of all elements not in $A: A = \{x: x ∉ A\}$. Clearly, $A ∩ A' = , A ∪ A' = U,'=U \& U' = .$
- The cardinality of a set $A$ measures its size and is shown as $|A|$. For finite sets it is the number of elements in the set and is often written as $n(A)$.

Some sets have special symbols.

Symbols for important sets
- The set of natural numbers is shown as N. N = {1, 2, 3, 4, …}
- The set of integers is shown as Z or J. Z = {… −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …}
- The set of rational numbers is shown as Q.
- The set of real numbers is shown as R.
- A superscript of + or − is used to show only positive or negative cases. Q+ means the positive rational numbers.
- A back slash can be used to show an omission. R/0 or R/{0} means the real numbers except 0.

Whole numbers are often shown as W = {0, 1, 2, 3, …} and some mathematicians use N, Z, Q and R for the natural numbers, integers, rational and real numbers.
