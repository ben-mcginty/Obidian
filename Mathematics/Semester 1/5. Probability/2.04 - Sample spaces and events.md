In junior mathematics you regarded experimental probability as being based on data and theoretical probability as being based on a list of possibilities. The fact that the list of possibilities in theoretical probability was actually based on experience was ignored. For example, we assume that there are two possible outcomes when a coin is thrown: heads and tails. This is based on experience. We also assume, based on experience, that heads and tails are equally likely.
There are 36 different ways that two dice can fall because for every possible number shown on the first, there are 6 possible numbers on the other. This means that there are 36 individual occurrences, even if you are only interested in the totals.
Most of the sample spaces you deal with are finite, which means that you do not need to consider some of the complexities of infinite sample spaces.
You choose a sample space so that it is most useful for the problem or situation under consideration.
The set S = {heads, tails} or {H, T} associated with tossing a coin is a simple example of a mathematical sample space. Would this sample space still be an appropriate model if the coins were thicker?
Each element of a sample space should correspond to a single separate possible occurrence in a real situation like the dice mentioned above.

You may recall using a tree diagram to show sample spaces like that in Example 10. The tree diagram for Example 10 is shown below ([[5.01 - Tree diagrams]])

The number of elements in an event is important in probability for finite sample spaces. The event E = ‘exactly two heads’ from the sample space above is {HHT, HTH, THH} so |E| = 3. This is often written as n(E). You can also use a table to show a sample space.
You can combine events in the same ways as other sets.

A and B means the intersection of the events A and B, A ∩ B.
A or B means the union of the events A and B, A ∪ B.
Not A means the complement of the event A, A or Aʹ.
