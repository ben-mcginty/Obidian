$(a\pm b)^{2}=a^{2}-2ab\pm b^{2}$
$(a+b)(a-b) = a^{2} - b^{2}$
$y=mx+c$
The distance between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by $d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$
The midpoint of two points $(x_1,x_2)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by $M=(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$|
The gradient of the straight line between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by $m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$
The gradient of a straight line is given by $m = tan (θ)$, where $θ$ is the angle that the line makes with the positive x-axis.
$m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$ OR $m=\frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}$
$x= a$ is a vertical line with x-intercept $a$. It is not a function, but a relation with domain $\{x: x = a\}$ and range $\{y: y ∈ R\}$. Its gradient is undefined.
# Quadratics
 For any quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ where $a ≠ 0$, the solutions are given by $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ -> $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ & $a\ne 0$
 $y = d(x – h)^2 + k$, turning point at $(h, k)$,  translation $h$ to the right and $k$ up, dilation of $y=x^{2}$ by $d$.
 From the quadratic formula, the zeros are the roots of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0, x=\frac{-b±\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. So the x-intercepts of the general parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ are at $(\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^{2}- 4ac}}{2a})$ and $(\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a})$.
The axis of symmetry will be halfway between these points. So its equation will be the average of the two roots. The turning point is on the axis of symmetry.
→ $x=\frac{\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}+\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}}{2}$
→ $x=\frac{\frac{-2b}{2a}}{2}$
→ $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$
The equation of a circle, centre $(a, b)$ and radius $r$ is $(x – a)^{2} + (y – b)^{2} = r^{2}$
# Polynomials
Quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic
- $(a+b)^{3}=a^{3}+3a^{2}b+3ab^{2}+b^{3}$
- $(a-b)^3=a^{3}-3a^{2}b+3ab^{2}-b^{3}$
**When a polynomial $P(x)$ is divided by $x − a$, the remainder is $P(a)$.**
If $P(x) = (x − a)(x − b)(x − c) = 0$, then the solutions are $x = a$, $x = b$, $x = c$.
Always look for a common factor, a perfect cube, sum or difference of cubes before trying other factorisation methods for cubic equations.

# Probability
 The set $A$ is a subset of the set $B$, written as $A ⊆ B$, if every element of $A$ is an element of $B$.
→ A proper subset is one that is definitely smaller, thus $A ⊂ B$ means that $A$ is a subset that is not equal to $B$.
→ The intersection of the sets $A$ and $B$, written as $A ∩ B$, is the set whose elements are elements of both $A$ and $B$.
→ The union of the sets $A$ and $B$, written as $A ∪ B$, is the set whose elements are elements of at least one of $A$ or $B$ (are in $A$ or $B$ or both).
→ The complement of the set A, written as $A′$ or $A$, is the set consisting of all elements not in $A: A = \{x: x ∉ A\}$. Clearly, $A ∩ A' = , A ∪ A' = U,'=U \& U' = .$
→ The cardinality of a set $A$ measures its size and is shown as $|A|$. For finite sets it is the number of elements in the set and is often written as $n(A)$.
$\binom{n}{r}=^{n}C_{r}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}=\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-r+1)}{r!}$
$P(E) ≈ \frac{f(E)}{n}$.
$P(A-B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A-and-B)$
