A polynomial equation such as $x^{3} + 3x + 5 = 0$ is not easily solved. In fact, only a small proportion of cubic and higher equations can be solved easily, and this is usually by using the factor theorem. You use the null factor law to solve cubic and quartic equations, as you did with quadratic equations.

Null factor law
If $abc = 0$, then at least one of $a = 0$, $b = 0$, $c = 0$ is true.
If $P(x) = (x − a)(x − b)(x − c) = 0$, then the solutions are $x = a$, $x = b$, $x = c$.
This is easily extended to any product of numbers.

Always look for a common factor, a perfect cube, sum or difference of cubes before trying other factorisation methods for cubic equations.
