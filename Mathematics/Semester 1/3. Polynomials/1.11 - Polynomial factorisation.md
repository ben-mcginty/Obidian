You use the method of long division to divide polynomials
When you work out $9515 ÷ 7$ using long division, you actually separate the division into place values, so in the thousands you divide $9$ thousand by $7$ first, getting $1$ thousand. 7 × 1 thousand = 7 thousand and 9 thousand − 7 thousand gives 2 thousand left over.
This is set out in the thousands place underneath.
You change the 2 thousand left over into 20 hundreds and add the 5 hundreds to get 25 hundreds. Then you divide the hundred by the 7 and repeat the process, so 25 hundreds divided by 7 gives 3 hundreds and 7 times 3 hundreds means that 21 hundreds have been used and there are 4 hundreds left over. The setting out is shown below.

Polynomial division is done the same way, but you separate the polynomial into descending powers instead of descending place values.

In general, if $P(x)$ is divided by $x − a$, the quotient is denoted by $Q(x)$ and the remainder is $R$. It is usual to represent a polynomial division in the form $P(x) = (x − a)Q(x) + R$
Dividing higher degree polynomials by smaller degree polynomials can help factorise them.

**When a polynomial $P(x)$ is divided by x − a, the remainder is $P(a)$.**
From Example 27 you know that when $P(x) = 3x3 − 8x2 + 7x − 1$ is divided by $x − 2$, the remainder is 5. You could use the remainder theorem to give the same result.
$P(x) = 3x^{3} − 8x^{2} + 7x − 1$
$P(2) = 3(2)^{3} − 8(2)^{2} + 7(2) − 1$
$= 3 × 8 − 8 × 4 + 7 × 2 − 1$
$= 5$

The factor theorem is a direct result of the remainder theorem. If a polynomial is divided by one of its factors then there is no remainder.

The factor theorem 
For a polynomial $P(x)$, if $P(a) = 0$, then x − a is a factor of the polynomial.
The converse of this theorem is also true.
For a polynomial $P(x)$, if $x$ − $a$ is a factor of the polynomial, then $P(a) = 0$.

Obviously, if $x$ − $a$ is a factor of the polynomial $P(x)$, then a is a factor of the constant of the polynomial. Although the reverse is not true, this can help narrow down the search for factors. It is always worth trying $1$ and $−1$.
