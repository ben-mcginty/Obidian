- An equation where the variable has a power of 2 is called a quadratic equation. It can also have a term with a power of 1 and/or a constant term. You can use the factorisation methods from Section 1.02 to solve some quadratic equations.
- If ab = 0, then either a = 0, b = 0 or a = b = 0.

- You can use other methods to solve quadratic equations.
- Completing the square is a technique that relies on the perfect square factorisation $x^2 + 2ax + a^2 = (x + a)^2$ . The two solutions are obtained using the fact that there are two numbers that square to give a positive number. For example, $6^2 = 36 = (−6)^2$ . The solution to $x^2 = 36$ is thus $±6$, which means $6$ or $−6$
- Completing the square
	1. Write the equation in general form.
	2. Divide each term by the coefficient of $x^2$ , unless it is 1.
	3. Put the constant term on the right-hand side of the equation
	4. Halve the coefficient of x to find the value of a in $x^2 + 2ax + a^2 = (x + a)^ 2$
	5. Square the value of a and add it to both sides.
	6. Factorise the left side as a perfect square.
	7. Take the square root of both sides, remembering to do both the positive and negative roots of the number on the RHS.
	8. Solve the two equations to find both solutions.
