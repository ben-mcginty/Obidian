In Chapter 1 you looked at inverse proportion. The hyperbola $y = \frac{k}{x}$ is the graph of an inverse proportion function. The hyperbola is a discontinuous function with vertical and horizontal asymptotes. It is called a rectangular hyperbola since the asymptotes are perpendicular (at right angles) to each other.
When $k > 0$ the hyperbola is in the first and third quadrants.
Both parts of the curve are decreasing, so the gradient is negative except at the vertical asymptote where the gradient does not exist.

When $k < 0$ the hyperbola is in the second and fourth quadrants.
Both parts of the curve are increasing, so the gradient is always positive except at the vertical asymptote.

You can use the domain and range to sketch a hyperbola.

**Polynomials of the form $y = x^2$**
Different types of polynomial functions have distinctive shapes. If you are familiar with these shapes, it will help you to draw the graphs of other polynomial functions.
NelsonNet has a spreadsheet named ‘Polynomials’ that lets you see how the graph of $y = x^n$ changes as the value of n changes.
Use the spreadsheet to see how the value of n affects the shape of the graph.
Write down any conclusions that you make.

Once you know the general shape of a polynomial, you can use translations and dilations to sketch the graphs of related polynomials.

The cubic function $y = x^3$ is an example of a polynomial. The general form of a cubic function is $y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$. This makes it difficult to compare with the graph of $y = x^3$ . However, you can sketch polynomials in this form by finding their intercepts.

If you use a CAS calculator to draw the graph above you will find that the local minimum between $–1$ and $0$ is not at $x = – \frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, the local maximum is not halfway between $0$ and $2$
