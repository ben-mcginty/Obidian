A circle is not a function. You can find its equation by using Pythagoras’ rule.

**Circle with centre at $(0, 0)$**
The equation of a circle with centre $(0, 0)$ and radius $r$ is $x^{2} +y^{2}= r^{2}$ .

The circle has centre $(0, 0)$ and radius $r$.
Let $(x, y)$ be a general point on the circle, with distances from the origin $x$ on the x-axis and $y$ on the y-axis as shown.
By Pythagoras’ theorem:
$a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$
thus, $x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}$

The equation of a circle, centre $(a, b)$ and radius $r$ is $(x – a)^{2} + (y – b)^{2} = r^{2}$

Take a general point on the circle, (x, y) and draw a right-angled triangle as shown.

Notice that the smaller sides of the triangle are $x$  – $a$ and $y$ - $b$ and the hypotenuse is $r$, the radius.
By Pythagoras’ theorem:
$a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$
$(x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}=r^{2}$

Sometimes you need to put the equation of a circle into the right form before you can find its radius and centre.

You know what the graph of the parabola $y = x^2$ looks like. The parabola $y^{2} = x$ is the inverse relation with the x and y values reversed.
Here is a table of values for $y^2 = x$ where you can use $y$ values of $–3$ to $3$ to find $x$.
| $x$   | $y$   |
| --- | --- |
| $9$   | $-3$  |
| $4$   | $-2$  |
| $1$   | $-1$  |
| $0$   | $0$   |
| $1$   | $1$   |
| $4$   | $2$   |
| $9$  | $3$   |
Drawing the graph gives us a parabola with turning point at $(0, 0)$ and a horizontal axis of symmetry.
Notice that this parabola is not a function. You can change the equation to $y = ± \sqrt{x}$.
Drawing both the functions $y=\sqrt{x}$ and $y=−\sqrt{x}$ together will give you the parabola.
