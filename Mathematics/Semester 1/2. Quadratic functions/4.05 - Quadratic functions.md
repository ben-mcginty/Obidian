You have seen quadratic functions such as $y = x^2$ in Years 9 and 10. The graph is called a parabola, a symmetrical curve with an axis of symmetry at the y-axis. It has a turning point at $(0, 0)$ which is the minimum point of the graph. 
The graph of any quadratic function $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is always a parabola.

For $a > 0, y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is concave upwards, with a minimum turning point.

For $a < 0, y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is concave downwards, with a maximum turning point.

The x-intercepts of a straight line are where $y = 0$. This applies to other functions including quadratics.
The zeros (roots) of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ give the x-intercepts of the quadratic function $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.

You can use translations to find different features of the quadratic function. For example, $y = (x – 3)^2$ is a horizontal translation of $y = x^2$ , moving 3 units to the right and $y = x^2 + 2$ is a vertical translation, moving 2 units upwards.
So $y = (x – 3)^2 + 2$ is a translation of $y = x^2$ moving 3 units to the right and 2 units up.
Notice that the equation of the axis of symmetry is $x = 3$ and the vertex (turning point) is the point $(3, 2)$.
You can change the equation of any quadratic function into the form $y = a(x – h)^2 + k$ by completing the square

For the quadratic function $y = d(x – h)^2 + k$, the equation of the axis of symmetry is $x = h$ and the turning point has coordinates $(h, k)$. It is a dilation of $y = x^2$ from the x-axis by the factor $d$ from $y = x^2$ followed by a translation $h$ to the right and $k$ up.

You can also find the equation of the axis of symmetry from a formula.
From the quadratic formula, the zeros are the roots of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0, x=\frac{-b±\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. So the x-intercepts of the general parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ are at $(\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^{2}- 4ac}}{2a})$ and $(\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a})$.
The axis of symmetry will be halfway between these points. So its equation will be the average of the two roots. The turning point is on the axis of symmetry.
- $x=\frac{\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}+\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}}{2}$
- $x=\frac{\frac{-2b}{2a}}{2}$
- $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$
The axis of symmetry of the parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ has the equation $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$
The coordinates of the turning point are $(-\frac{b}{2a}, f(-\frac{b}{2a}))$.
