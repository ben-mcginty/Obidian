You can draw a parabola using the zeros and turning point or y-intercept. A parabola is also uniquely determined by three points.
The equation of a quadratic function in the form $y = d(x – h)^{2} + k$ may also be found if you know its turning point and one other point.

In Chapter 1 ([[1.08 - The quadratic formula and  the discriminant]]), you used the discriminant to find if a quadratic equation had 0, 1 or 2 roots. The zeros of a quadratic function are the roots of the corresponding equation, so the number of roots of the equation is the same as the number of zeros of the function.

The discriminant of the quadratic function $y = ax2 + bx + c is ∆ = b2 – 4ac$.
