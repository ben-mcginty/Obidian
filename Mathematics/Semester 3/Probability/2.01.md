In probability, an experiment has a number of outcomes, Each outcome is called a sample point and the sample space of an experiment is all possible outcomes. An event is a subset of the sample space.
Consider the spinner shown here.

If event A is defined as 'an even number' and event B is defined as 'a multiple of 3', then:
$A={2,4,6,8,10}$
$B={3,6,9}$
The sample space $S$ ist he set of individual possible occurrences, so in this case, $S={1,2,3,...,10}$.
The union ($\cup$) of $A$ and $B$ is the combination of either event $A$ or event $B$ or both $A$ and $B$
occurring. So $A\cup B={2,3,4,6,8,9,10}$
The intersection ($\cap$) of $A$ and $B$ is the event that both $A$ and $B$ occur and includes the sample points that are common to $A$ and $B$. So $A\cap B = {6}$.
Venn diagrams are used to visualise events, using circles in a rectangle to represent $S$.

The probability of an event is the likelihood or chance of it occurring, so $P(A)=\frac{5}{9}$ and $P(A\cup B)=\frac{7}{9}$

>The probability of an event A in a sample space S is written as P(A) and is a real number between 0 and 1. The probability of the sample space, P(S) = 1 and the probability of a union of disjoint events is the sum of their probabilities
>For a finite sample space whose elements have equal probabilities,
>$P(A)=\frac{total\, number\, of\, favourable\, outcomes}{total\, number\, of\, possible\, oucomes}=\frac{n(A)}{n(S)}$
>If $P(A)=1$, then $A$ is certain to occur.
>If $P(A)=0$, then $A$ is impossible.
>The complement of event $A$ is represented as $A'$. It means ‘not $A$’, so $P(A')$ is the probability that $A$ will not occur.
>$P(A)+P(A')=1$
>$P(A')=1-P(A)$

>[!important]+
>The addition rile of probability states that:
>$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$
>$P(A\cup B)$ is also written as $P(A or B)$.
>$P(A\cap B)$ is also written as $P(A and B)$.
>Mutually exclusive events cannot occur simultaneously, so $P(A ∩ B) = 0$. For mutually exclusive events: $P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)$
>The conditional probability of event $A$ given event $B$ is written as $P(A|B)$ or ‘the probability of $A$ given $B$’ and defined as $P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$.
>The multiplication rule for any events $A$ and $B$ is $P(A\cap B)=P(A|B)\times P(B)$.
>Events are independent if $P(A|B) = P(A)$. The outcome of one does not affect the probability of the other, so $P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)$.

You should remember from Year 11 that conditional probability is often used when events occur one after another, but it can be used in unordered situations as well

>[!example]+ Example 1
>Sam knows that if she wakes up when her phone alarm goes off, she has a 90% chance of getting to school on time. If she sleeps through the alarm, she only has a 40% chance of getting to school on time. Because she sometimes sleeps heavily, she only wakes up when the alarm rings 80% of the time. Calculate these probabilities
