In probability, an experiment has a number of outcomes, Each outcome is called a sample point and the sample space of an experiment is all possible outcomes. An event is a subset of the sample space.
Consider the spinner shown here.
![[Pasted image 20230201191349.png]]
If event A is defined as 'an even number' and event B is defined as 'a multiple of 3', then:
$A={2,4,6,8,10}$
$B={3,6,9}$
The sample space $S$ ist he set of individual possible occurrences, so in this case, $S={1,2,3,...,10}$.
The union ($\cup$) of $A$ and $B$ is the combination of either event $A$ or event $B$ or both $A$ and $B$
occurring. So $A\cup B={2,3,4,6,8,9,10}$
The intersection ($\cap$) of $A$ and $B$ is the event that both $A$ and $B$ occur and includes the sample points that are common to $A$ and $B$. So $A\cap B = {6}$.
Venn diagrams are used to visualise events, using circles in a rectangle to represent $S$.

The probability of an event is the likelihood or chance of it occurring, so $P(A)=\frac{5}{9}$ and $P(A\cup B)=\frac{7}{9}$

>The probability of an event A in a sample space S is written as P(A) and is a real number between 0 and 1. The probability of the sample space, P(S) = 1 and the probability of a union of disjoint events is the sum of their probabilities
>For a finite sample space whose elements have equal probabilities,
>$P(A)=\frac{total\, number\, of\, favourable\, outcomes}{total\, number\, of\, possible\, oucomes}=\frac{n(A)}{n(S)}$
>If $P(A)=1$, then $A$ is certain to occur.
>If $P(A)=0$, then $A$ is impossible.
>The complement of event $A$ is represented as $A'$. It means ‘not $A$’, so $P(A')$ is the probability that $A$ will not occur.
>$P(A)+P(A')=1$
>$P(A')=1-P(A)$

>[!important]+
>The addition rile of probability states that:
>$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$
>$P(A\cup B)$ is also written as $P(A or B)$.
>$P(A\cap B)$ is also written as $P(A and B)$.
>Mutually exclusive events cannot occur simultaneously, so $P(A ∩ B) = 0$. For mutually exclusive events: $P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)$
>The conditional probability of event $A$ given event $B$ is written as $P(A|B)$ or ‘the probability of $A$ given $B$’ and defined as $P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$.
>The multiplication rule for any events $A$ and $B$ is $P(A\cap B)=P(A|B)\times P(B)$.
>Events are independent if $P(A|B) = P(A)$. The outcome of one does not affect the probability of the other, so $P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)$.

You should remember from Year 11 that conditional probability is often used when events occur one after another, but it can be used in unordered situations as well

>[!example]+ Example 1
>Sam knows that if she wakes up when her phone alarm goes off, she has a 90% chance of getting to school on time. If she sleeps through the alarm, she only has a 40% chance of getting to school on time. Because she sometimes sleeps heavily, she only wakes up when the alarm rings 80% of the time. Calculate these probabilities
>a. She wakes up when the alarm rings and she gets to school late.
>b. She gets to school on time.
>c. She gets to school late.
>d. She wakes up when the alarm rings, given that she gets to school on time.

In Example 1, the outcomes are occurrences in the real world. You can also have a sample space with numerical outcomes. Consider a fair coin that is tossed three times and counting the number of tails in a row. You can use a tree diagram or list to work out the probabilities of each outcome.
There are four different possibilities: 0, 1, 2 and 3 tails, but there are 8 equally likely elements in the sample space. The probabilities of tails in a row are shown below
| tails in a row | outcomes           | probability   |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| 0              | HHH                | $\frac{1}{8}$ |
| 1              | HHT, HTH, THH, THT | $\frac{1}{2}$ |
| 2              | HTT, TTH           | $\frac{1}{4}$ |
| 3              | TTT                | $\frac{1}{8}$              |

In this case, the events are part of a sample space and have a numeric variable associated with them. The variable is the number of successive tails, T. You cannot tell what the value will be, so you say that it is random. It can only have the values 0, 1, 2 and 3, so it is a discrete variable, but you can work out the probability of each value.
>[!important]+
>A random variable is a variable with a numerical value determined by events from a sample space. Each value has an associated probability. A random variable is discrete if the possible values (the domain) are discrete. A continuous random variable has a continuous domain.
>A random variable is usually denoted by a capital letter. The corresponding lower-case letter denotes specific values of the variable.
>The probability function of a discrete random variable is the function formed by the values of the variable and their probabilities. For the random variable $X$, the probability function is shown as $P(X = x)$ or $p(x)$.

You can show a function as a list (set) of ordered pairs, table or rule. For the variable $T$ above, $p(0) = 0.125$, $p(1) = 0.5$, $p(2) = 0.25$ and $p(3) = 0.125$.

>[!example]+ Example 2
>A pair of fair dice is tossed and the total of the uppermost faces is noted. 
>a. If $X$ = total of the uppermost faces, show that $X$ is a discrete random variable. 
>b. List the probability function
>a. Domain of $X={2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}$
>b. ![[Pasted image 20230201201643.png]]
>![[Pasted image 20230201202226.png]]
>$p(2)=\frac{1}{36}$
>$p(3)=\frac{1}{18}$
>$p(4)=\frac{1}{12}$
>$p(5)=\frac{1}{9}$
>$p(6)=\frac{5}{36}$
>$p(7)=\frac{1}{6}$
>$p(8)=\frac{5}{36}$
>$p(9)=\frac{1}{9}$
>$p(10)=\frac{1}{12}$
>$p(11)=\frac{1}{18}$
>$p(12)=\frac{1}{36}$

You could also show the probability function as a list of ordered pairs:
$(2,\frac{1}{36})(3,\frac{1}{18})(4,\frac{1}{12})(5,\frac{1}{9})(6,\frac{5}{36})(7,\frac{1}{6})(8,\frac{5}{36})(9,\frac{1}{9})(10,\frac{1}{12})(11,\frac{1}{18})(12,\frac{1}{36})$
or as the rule:
$p(x)=\frac{x-1}{36}\, for\, 2\leq x\leq7$
$p(x)=\frac{13-x}{36}\, for\, 8\leq x\leq12$
