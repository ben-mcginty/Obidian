It is often useful to display the values of a discrete random variable with their probabilities. You usually draw the graph of a probability distribution like a histogram, without spaces between the columns, to emphasise the connection with statistical graphs. They are called probability histograms. You can use probability properties to get the general properties of discrete probability distributions.
