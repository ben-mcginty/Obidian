It is often useful to display the values of a discrete random variable with their probabilities. You usually draw the graph of a probability distribution like a histogram, without spaces between the columns, to emphasise the connection with statistical graphs. They are called probability histograms. You can use probability properties to get the general properties of discrete probability distributions.

>A discrete probability function (discrete probability distribution) shows the probability of a discrete random variable as a list, table or graph.
>A discrete probability function P(X = x) has the following properties.
>- the values are between 0 and 1: $0\leq P(X = x)\leq 1$ for all values Of x
>- The sum of all the probabilities is 1. This is written as $\Sigma P(X = x) = 1$.
>- $p(x)$ is a function, so every value of $x$ has only one value of $p(x)$

The Greek letter Σ is widely used in Mathematics to mean ‘the sum of ’. If there are no subscripts, then it means ‘the sum of all values’, as in the case above.
On the other hand $\displaystyle\sum_{5}^{i=1}x_{i}=x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}+x_{5}$ and $\displaystyle\sum_{n=4}^{6}n^{3}=4^{3}+5^{3}+6^{3}$.
Provided that the values of X are discrete, the properties are sufficient to show that a function p(x) is a discrete probability distribution. Of course, different values of x can have the same probability.
