The expected value of a discrete random variable is a measure of its average value. In this section you will look at measuring the spread of a discrete random variable. Intuitively, the distance of a value from the mean measures how far apart that item is from the standard result, so the average distance from the mean would be a measure of spread. However, if you added the values of $x − \mu$, the ones above the mean would cancel out the ones below. Squaring the distance from the mean makes them all positive so the sum is not zero, and emphasises the values further from the mean. Hence the average of the squares of the distances from the mean gives a reasonable measure of spread. This is $E([X−\mu]^{2})$. The square root of this value will give a value on the same scale as the original variable. $E([X−\mu]^{2})$ can be converted to a more convenient form for calculation as follows.

$E([X-\mu]^{2})=\sum[X-\mu]^{2}p(x)$
$=\sum\limits X^{2}p(x)-\sum\limits2X\mu p(x)+\sum\limits\mu^{2}p(x)$
$=E(X^{2})-2\mu\sum\limits Xp(x)+\mu^{2}\sum\limits p(x)$
Since $\mu=\sum\limits Xp(x)$ and $\sum\limits p(x)=1$, then
$E(X^{2})-2\mu\sum\limits Xp(x)+\mu^{2}\sum\limits p(x)=E(X^{2})-2\mu\mu+\mu^{2}$
$=E(X^{2})-2\mu^{2}+\mu^{2}$
$=E(X^{2})-\mu^{2}$
Hence $E([X-\mu]^{2})=E(X^{2})-\mu^{2}$
