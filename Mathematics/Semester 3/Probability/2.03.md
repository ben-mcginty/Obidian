You can use data to estimate probabilities. You need to count the number of times an event occurs in the data.

>[!important]
>The relative frequency of an event is an estimate of its probability. It is given by
>$Relative\, frequency=\frac{frequenct\, of\, event}{total\, number\, of\, observations}=\frac{frequency\, of\, event}{total\, frequency}$
>The observations are usually called trials.
