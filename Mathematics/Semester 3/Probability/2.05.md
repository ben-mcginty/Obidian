In this section, you will look at a simple non-uniform discrete probability distribution that frequently arises in quality control.

>[!important]
>In a hypergeometric experiment, a sample of a particular number of items is taken from a finite population without replacement. The population is divided into two types, classified as success and failure, bad and good, or $1$ and $0$, with a fixed number of successes. The result of the experiment is the number of successes in the sample.
>The sample size is usually written as $n$, the population size as $N$ and the number of successes in the population is often written as $k$ or $M$.

As shown in Example 9, there is a discrete random variable associated with hypergeometric experiments.

>[!important]
>A hypergeometric distribution is the probability distribution of a hypergeometric experiment. The random variable is the number of successes. For a hypergeometric distribution with a sample size of n from a population of $N$ with $k$ successes, $X$ has a domain from $0$ to the minimum of $n$ and $k$.

You can calculate the probabilities $P(X = x)$ in a hypergeometric probability distribution using the methods you learnt last year.
There are $\binom{k}{x}(^{k}C_{x})$ ways of choosing $x$ sucesses from the $k$ sucesses in the population.
There are $\binom{N-k}{n-x}$ ways of choosing $n-x$ failures from the $N-k$ failures in the population.
