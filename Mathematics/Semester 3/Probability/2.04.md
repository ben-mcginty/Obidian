In the previous sections the discrete probability functions were not constant. Cases where the probability function is constant occur quite frequently.

>[!Example]+ Example 7
>A normal six-sided die is rolled and the uppermost number is noted.
>a) Draw a graph of the probability distribution.
>b) Calculate the probability that the number is greater than 4.

The probability distribution in Example 7 is called a uniform distribution. The graph is a rectangle. The characteristics are as follows.

>[!important]+
>A uniform discrete probability distribution has equally likely outcomes.
>For a domain with $n$ elements, the probability function is $P(X=x)=\frac{1}{n}$.
>If the domain is the integers from $a$ to $b$ inclusive, then $n=b-a+1$, so $P(X=x)=\frac{1}{b-a+1}$
>It follows that, for this domain, $P(c\leq x\leq d)=\frac{d-c+1}{b-a+1}$, where $a\leq c\leq d\leq b$.
>A uniform distribution is often called a rectangular distribution


If the clubs in a normal pack of cards are numbered from 11 to 23, the diamonds from 24 to 36, the hearts from 37 to 49 and the spades from 50 to 62, the domain is ${ 11,12,13,...,62}$ and $p(x)=\frac{1}{52}$.
Some people prefer to say that the answer to part c of Example 8 is P(x = 7) = 0. You can use a slightly different definition of a discrete uniform probability distribution to allow for cases like this.

>[!important]+
>A uniform discrete probability distribution can be defined as a distribution that has n outcomes with equal probabilities, where $p(x)=\frac{1}{n}$ for $x∈D$ and $p(x)=0$ for $x ∉ D$.

Choosing a random number from 10 to 50 inclusive is a use of the discrete uniform probability distribution on the integers from 10 to 50.
