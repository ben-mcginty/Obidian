  The Truman show & Fahrenheit 451

 His job is boring and dull, and at the whim of the producers.  His job is exciting, but dull, and at the whim of the government.
 He has trust issues. He has trust issues.

 What they tried to warn us about.

1. People have chosen to live a life with no privacy.
   2. Reality media is dehumanising.
    3. Reality is being controlled.

 Symbolism in the Truman show
 The sea.
 The 'sea' is the main symbol of confinement, fear and freedom.
 It represents fear as his father 'died' at sea, and it represents freedom as it is the only way to leave Seahaven.  

 Bridges
 They offer a long and difficult escape route. Other bridges are a dead end - offering no escape at all.

 White picket fences
 Suggests entrainment - a lovely fence to keep you in. It also promotes the idea of the idea of the American dream.  

 The Wall
 The wall that Truman hits is the end of his known world. The wall is a metaphor for the world that he trapped Truman since birth, and the has now been reborn into the 'real world'. Truman said goodbye to his creator and to his audience and left the stage.

 Dogs
 Pluto the Dalmatian is part of his daily routine and then becomes a snarling tracker dog; the woman with the Dashaud abandons it when she chases after Kirk, 'Dog Fancy' is a prominent product that is advertised. Sirius the dog star. Young Truman is threatened by a savage guard dog on the bridge, hence Trumans fear of Pluto.

 The Moon
 It is constantly in the sky keeping an eye on Truman. The moon helps Christof look down on his 'creation'

 Fiji
 Fiji is about freedom from Seahaven, It is where Sylvia is - a person that he felt a genuine connection with.

 Newspaper
 The newspaper was used to spread misinformation to Truman. It was used to show how routine his life was, but changed later in the film when he doesn't buy a newspaper, signifying how he is starting to rebel.

 Collage of Sylvia
 The collage odd Sylvia is a way of keeping the memory of her alive. It is kept in his 'secret' place in the basement. His goal is to reunite with her in Fiji.

 Beer from Marlon.
 Beer is used for two main reasons. It is shown for commercial purposes as this helps fund the TV show. It is also used to show mateship between Marlon and Truman.  

 "in case i don't see you, good afternoon, good evening and good night."
 This is said at the beginning and end of the film. At the end of the film, he says the same thing, and he has reclaimed his own life.

 The Truman show is a nonlinear narrative, it is a successful way of showing the confusion when it comes to unfolding events and the discovery Truman makes of the 'perfect' world he lives in isn't perfect at all.
 This 'perfect world' we see at the beginning are all actually underlying examples of Todorov's theory of equilibriums. Everything may not be wat they appear to be because everything is too 'perfect'  

 Christof Peter Weir  
 Portrays Trumans' life as perfect so the perfect narrative.    No chronological structure
 Shows that a 'perfect world' should have a perfect structure   Represents Christof's world as not realistic
 Perfect narrative - problem to be solved in quick time like tv shows and movies. Show us that reality does not have a perfect structure
    Life is always going in different directions
    Life is not just that simple
