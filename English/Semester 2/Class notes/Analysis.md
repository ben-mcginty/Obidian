How do the characters in 'Fahrenheit 451' and 'The Truman Show' accept the reality that they are presented with?

The Truman Show

Truman (initially) accepts the normality of his situation, but because he knows no different.

-   Trumans reality is fabricated, once he realises this he has to leave.
-   Truman's 'family and friends' sacrifice reality for fame and money. Meryl breaks character.
-   Audience views the show as entertainment, sympathise with Truman. However, they objectify Truman and accept his reality without questioning Christof's ethics. Lines are blurred between fiction and the real world

-   Security guards question "What else is on?"

Fahrenheit 451

-   Clarisse questions reality because she has been raised to be curious and inquisitive to reject the fast-paced lifestyle and influence of technology.

-   No one questions her death.

-   Montag typical dystopian protagonist initially accepts reality, then begins to question.
-   Captain Beatty perpetuates and accept the highly censored society by confining and advocating the for the burning of books.
-   Paramedics have been desensitised to things like overdose and suicide
-   Mildred and others conform to social norms and reject books, live in a fictionalised state, interact with family/friends in the parlour walls
