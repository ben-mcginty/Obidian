-How does this discussion between Faber and Montag reflect a possible theme in this novel? Make sure you identify what this theme is...

-What is it that Montag seems to be craving that he isn't able to get in his daily life?

-How does Faber's response reflect something about him as a person?  What does Faber mean when he says, "It's not books you need, it's some of the things that once were in books."

<"Nobody listens any more.  I can't talk to the walls because they're yelling at me.  I can't talk to my wife; she listens to the walls.  I just want someone to hear what I have to say.  And maybe if I talk long enough, it'll make sense.  And I want you to teach me to understand what I read...."

"You're a hopeless romantic," said Faber.  "It would be funny if it were not serious.  It's not books you need, it's some of the things that once were in books.  The same things could be in the 'parlor families' today... Books were only one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget.  There is nothing magical in them, at all.  The magic is only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us.">

Montag and Faber talk about what books mean to them. Montag says that he cant say anything, and that no one will listen to him. Faber says that he wants love, and that he is a 'hopeless' romantic. The theme that this reflects is that Montag wants love, but cannot get it because everyone is distracted, uncaring and impersonal. Montag wants love, but cannot get it in his life, and Faber's response shows that what we need is love, not love via stories.
