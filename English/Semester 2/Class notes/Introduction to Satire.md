Satire is the use of wit to ridicule some human foible or social institution in order to effect change.

A work that ridicules its subject in order to make a comment about it.
Although satire is usually witty, and often very funny, the purpose of satire is to criticize in order to shame something into reform

	language that describes something better or worse than it really is (over-exaggeration)
		EX: From Joseph Conrad’s novel *The Heart of Darkness*: “I had to wait in the station for ten days - an eternity.”

	to say that (something) is smaller, less important, etc., than it really is
		EX: In J.D. Salinger’s *Catcher in the Rye*, Holden Caulfield says: “I have to have this operation. It isn’t very serious, I have this tiny little tumour on the brain.”

	Putting things together that normally wouldn’t go together
	This can be used to make ordinary things seem ridiculous
