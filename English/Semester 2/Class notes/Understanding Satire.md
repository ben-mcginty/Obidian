The playbook cartoon
Trump is using the police force to get a goal, at the expense of people who he thinks are lesser, and those who he thinks are not as important as him.
He is using the police force to target the ‚Äòenemy‚Äô (black people), and to get his agenda done.

The scientist is telling the pope that he should be worrying about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The person, who is white, a bit tubby, and old has a Pro-life shirt and a gun tucked into his pants, and a coloured MAGA cap, which is the only coloured part of the illustration.

**Hello, I‚Äôm from the Australien Government
Are you hoping to become an Australian citizen?
If so, you‚Äôll need to learn about Australien Values
As the seat of Government, Parliament House is the logical place to learn about Australian Values
Whether it be bullying, sexual harassment, cover-ups
Or simply jizzing on womens‚Äô desks, we know how to set the example
AUSTRALIEN VALUES
Knowing Australien Values will help you fit in to our society and have a job
Such as Australien Value no. 22
Nobody In This Government Faces Any Fucking Consequences For Their Actions
Like Angus, whose office forged documents
Or Bridge, who rorted taxpayer funds
Or half our Ministers, who covered up the rape of a staffer in Parliament House
And they all still have jobs!
AUSTRALIEN VALUES
Respecting Australien Values allows us to get on with our shitfuckery
Such as Value 52: We Don‚Äôt Investigate our Ministers‚Äô Shitfuckery
Like Angus: where we got police to drop the investigation
Or Bridge: where we obstructed the investigation.
Or Chris: who can‚Äôt face an inquiry because there‚Äôs no active police investigation
Or half our Ministers: who can‚Äôt face an inquiry because there IS an active police investigation
There‚Äôs always a good reason not to have an investigation!
AUSTRALIEN VALUES
Knowing Australien Values will help you stay out of trouble
Such as Value 31: If You See Us Breaking The Law, Shut The Fuck Up
Coz if you report on our conduct
Or blow the whistle on our corruption, war crimes and corporate espionage
We‚Äôll ruin you
Like we‚Äôre doing to these guys
AUSTRALIEN VALUES
We work hard to uphold these Values, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôve repeatedly voted against a federal ICAC
We‚Äôve even voted against a code of conduct in Parliament House
Coz that would go against Australien Value no 16:
Do Whatever The Fuck We Want In Parliament House
Such as banging in the prayer room
Getting trollied on the job
Banging our staffers on the job
And making women feel afraid to report sexual assaults for fear of losing their job
AUSTRALIEN VALUES
If you‚Äôre ever unsure, look to our Prime Minister for leadership on Australien Values
Such as Value no. 8
Show No Leadership.
Ever.
Like leaving for Hawai‚Äôi when the country‚Äôs on fire
Leaving it to State Premiers to handle a pandemic
Leaving it to Jenny to tell you to empathise with a rape survivor
And hiding under your desk instead of going outside to meet the thousands of lying cow‚Ä¶
I mean, women marching
to demand an end to gendered violence and discrimnation in Parliament House
But hey, look on the bright side
at least we didn‚Äôt Shoot Those Thousands of Women Marching on Parliament House
Which of course is Australian Value no. 81
AUSTRALIEN VALUES
Good luck with your citizenship test. And make sure to brush up on Australien Values
Especially Value no. 1
‚ÄúIf You Have a Go, You Get a Go‚Äù
What‚Äôs that?
Don‚Äôt have any Go‚Äôs?
Aww honey, then you Get to Go fuck yoursel‚Ä¶
AUSTRALIEN VALUES
And remember: English is our national language
Learning it will help you understand what Aussies mean when they tell you:
yeah nah mate this Government‚Äôs a bunch of shitcunts
