Fahrenheit 451 was published in 1953

It isÂ  novel of social criticism that warns against the dangers of supressing thought through censorship.

It uses the conventions of science fiction to convey a message that "oppressive government left unchecked, can do irreparable damage to society by limiting the creativity and freedom of its people".

Fahrenheit 451 was developed in the years immediately following WW2

It condemns not only the anti-intellectualism of Nazi Germany (book burnings), but also America in the 1950s - the heyday of McCarthyism, and a growing fear of communism.

Other influential social criticisms of the time include 1984 and animal farm.
