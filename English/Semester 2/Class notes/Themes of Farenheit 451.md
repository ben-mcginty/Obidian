Censorship;

Censorship is defined as the removal or withholding of information from the public by a controlling group or body,

Typically done by governments, religious and secular groups, corporations or the mass media.

Censorship in the novel;

In the world of F451, books are burned because they trigger thought and discontent, two things that are unwelcome in this 'happiness oriented' society,

What's unexpected about the censorship in F451 is that it seems to have originated with the people, not the government.

Ignorance vs. Knowledge

What does true happiness consist of?

Is ignorance bliss, or do knowledge and learning provide true happiness?

In this world, firemen promote ignorance by destroying books—and with them—knowledge.

Technology-Deadening Human Experience

Technology in Bradbury’s 24th century is highly advanced and dominates society.

TV, radio broadcasts, fast cars and atomic weapons dominate people’s experiences—at the expense of things like nature, music and poetry.

Dystopian Society

The “Dystopia” motif, popular in science fiction—that of a technocratic and totalitarian society that demands order at the expense of individual rights—is central to the novel.
