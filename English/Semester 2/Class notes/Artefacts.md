Ray Bradbury says that Fahrenheit 451 has been misinterpreted. He got a citation when the Pulitzer prizes were awarded, however he was not allowed to give a speech and stayed at home.

Paragraph 1: Summarise the artefact

Paragraph 2-3: Analyse the artefact→ Break it down, explain what it is, how it works, it’s purpose, tone/focus, etc.

Paragraph 4: Connect it back to a quote from Fahrenheit 451 and explain why the connection you made is important.

The cartoons depict people utilising technology at the cost of human interaction, and the person is engrossed in technology, whilst not interacting with other people in real life.

The artefact is used to show people the possible consequences of using technology too much, as it will kill off real human interaction. Its tone is showing people to be concerned about what continued use could lead to.

It is warning the viewer that exposed and continuous use of electronic devices could lead to dire consequences, and that people should be concerned about what it may lead to.

"It's really fun. It'll be even more fun when we can afford to have the fourth wall installed. How long you figure before we save up and get the fourth wall torn out and a fourth wall-TV put in? It's only two thousand dollars." This quote shows us the addiction of people that they want more 'walls' installed at the cost of real social interaction.
