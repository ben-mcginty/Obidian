| It is the duty of the government to train and educate its youth to be productive, loyal anduseful adult citizens                                                                           | Disagree, it solely falls on the parents, who need to raise their children properly, but the government may need to intervene at a suitable time for people to become good adults.                                                            |
| It is impossible to change history. You cannot change the past                                                                                                                             | Agree, time is irreversible, and choices in the past impact the future, and whilst it can be covered up, it is impossible to change the past.                                                                                                 |
| The government should use technological advances (such as spying methods, surveillance technology and communications) in order to ensure stability, peace and order throughout the country | Disagree, if the government uses highly invasive methods to investigate it citizens lives, it is a violation of Human rights, and it is a dictatorship (China seems to agree, and all citizens are monitored)                                 |
| The world would be a much simpler place if everyone spoke the exact same language.                                                                                                         | Agree, and disagree. The world would be duller if everybody spoke the same language, however it would make communication much easier, at the cost of cultural diversity.                                                                      |
| Different people sometimes deserve different rights; however, everyone should have the right to freedom of speech, thought and religion.                                                   | Disagree, everyone (at least adults) should have the same set of rights and responsibilities, which will allow the world to become a better place. If it were true, slaves would have no rights, and their masters would have all the rights. |
| A good citizen is patriotic, loyal and never questions the government’s authority.                                                                                                         | Disagree, questioning authority is the core to a well-functioning county,  and people should think about the decisions that other people make, which is a fundamental part of the judicial system.                                            |
