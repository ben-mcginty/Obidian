Fear and Newspeak

Fear

When I was 5 I was afraid of...

-    The road and the fast cars on said road. 🏎️
-   Being up high. 🗼
-   Flying on a plane. 👩‍✈️

When I was 10 I was afraid of....

-    Heights (lesser extent). 🗼
-   Getting mugged. 🗡️

When I was 15 I was afraid of....

-    People dying. ☠️

Right now I’m afraid of….

-    People dying. ☠️
-   Driving on very fast roads 🏎️

In 5 years time I don’t want to be afraid of....

-    Death ☠️
-   Driving quickly 🏎️

In 50 years time I might be afraid of....

-    My own morality ⚰️

“Anything that hinted at corruption always filled him with a wild hope.”

Imagine a world where the government saw everything you did; read every text message you wrote; every site you visited online; heard every word you spoke. You live in constant fear, you have no escape.

Now imagine you have found one place where they can’t find you, one place where you cannot be traced. What would you do? What would you say?

I would try to cause hyperinflation in order to cause and economic crisis and have the government overthrown, and then install proper measures to have a democratic country.

Imagine yourself as Winston Smith at the beginning of 1984. What would you do to undermine The Party? Knowing what you know now, how would you extricate yourself from the fate that awaits you?

 I would try to make the upper party members question themselves, install a puppet government and then install a proper government. I would attempt to get mainstream support for my cause, and then establish a new country/countries

Newspeak

“Don't you see the whole aim of newspeak is to narrow the range of thought?”

Syme : It’s a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course, the great wastage is in the verbs and the adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. And antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of another word? A word contains it’s opposite in itself.

Wins ton: Really?

Syme : Take ‘good’ for example. What need is there for a word like ‘bad’ when ‘ungood’ will do the just the same thing, or better because it’s an exact opposite. Or if you want a stronger word than ‘good’ what sense is there in having a huge string of vague useless words like ‘splendid’ or ‘excellent’? ‘Plusgood’ covers the meaning, or ‘double-plusgood’ if you want something stronger still. Don’t you see the beauty in that Winston? It was BB’s idea originally of course…

Winston’s inner thoughts.

Winston: One of these days you will be vapourized. You are too intelligent. You see too clearly and speak too plainly. The party does not like such people. One day you will simply disappear. It is written in your face.

1.  Discuss with a pair what you think the purpose of this excerpt is. What do we learn about each of the characters?

We learn that Winston is internally opposing the Party, whist Syme appears to be completely in favour of the Party's rule.

1.  Why would Big Brother want to decrease the amount of words in the dictionary? What would that do to communication?

He would want the population to think what he wants you to think. He wants the words that could be used to overthrow the Party gone.

1.  Look up the word portmanteau and write down its meaning. What examples exist in this script excerpt and in 1984?

"a word blending the sounds and combining the meanings of two others, for example motel or brunch."

Doublethink is a portmanteau, and it means thinking about two things.

1.  Binary Opposites are two ideas that are opposite and are used in texts so the audience understands the message. For example love/hate is a binary opposite. We only understand love because we understand hate. What will happen if Big Brother abolishes some words/ideas?

We can't understand the others. If there is no love, we can't understand hate.

1.  Recreate the extract using words in a non-conventional way. What conventions could you use to show Winston’s thoughts?

The removal of words is plusgood, however the waste is ungood, why have an opposite of a word when 'un' will do the same thing.

Really?

Take ‘good’ for example. Why have ‘bad’ when ‘ungood’ will do the same thing. Or if you want a stronger word than ‘good’ why have a lot of unuseful words like ‘splendid’ or ‘excellent’? ‘Plusgood’ covers the meaning, or ‘double-plusgood’ if it must be stronger. It is doublepluslovely. Do you see that Winston?

1.  According to the novel, Newspeak is supposed to be fully integrated into mainstream life by 2050. After referring to your dictionary have a go at writing a scene between Syme and Winston that uses more Newspeak words.

Hello Winston

Hello Syme

How are you?

I'm good.

That plusgood!
