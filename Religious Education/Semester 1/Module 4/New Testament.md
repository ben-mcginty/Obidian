[[Matthew's Gospel]] [[Covenants]]
In comparison with the Old

**The Gospels**
The gospels are often thought of as biographies of Jesus. This is not really very helpful, because biography as we know it today, is quite different to what the gospels are about. It is probably more accurate and helpful to think of the gospels as dramatic meditations on the meaning and impact that Jesus had for the various Christian communities, who commissioned the writing of these texts. If we read them as 'biography' or 'history' in the modern sense of these words, we will misunderstand them. We will also find 'contradictions' where the original authors and audiences would have found different emphases and shades of meaning instead.

The gospels named after Matthew, Mark and Luke - who were not so much their authors as the authorities who are traditionally associated with these texts* - wrote very similar narratives, though not identical. These three gospels came to be called 'synoptic'.

The Fourth Gospel - which tradition associates with the Apostle John - is quite different. It is even more dramatic and certainly far more poetic, almost liturgical in its language and arrangement of the action. Perhaps the best way to read the gospels is first to watch, or at least read, one of the ancient Greek plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles or Euripides. After all, the gospels were written long before the modern novel, biography or history. They require a lot of imagination and attention to symbolism if they are to be appreciated for what they really are, i.e. profound spiritual meditations on a mystery that grows, the deeper we enter into it and the more we learn from it.

*NB: while Matthew is the apostle whose authority gives us the gospel named after him, behind Mark's Gospel is the authority of the Apostle Peter, and behind Luke's, some feel that of the Apostle Paul

**Acts of the Apostles**
The Acts of the Apostles is the second volume of Luke's Gospel. Its main purpose is to show how the church continued the mission of Jesus in the power of his Spirit. One of the key figures in the Acts of the Apostles is St Paul - hence the traditional association of Luke's Gospel with the apostolic authority of Paul.

**Letters of St. Paul**
The thirteen letters attributed to Paul are probably the oldest part of the New Testament. We know with certainty that only seven of these letters were written by Paul. Known as the undisputed letters, they comprise Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, 1 Thessalonians, Philippians and Philemon. The remaining six were most probably written by disciples of Paul and comprise Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus.

The thirteen letters were written to groups of Christians in various places outside of Judea and Palestine. All of them, with the exception of Romans, were attempts to address specific issues and problems that arose in those communities, or to answer questions raised by them. Although they are far from being a systematic explanation of the Christian faith, they are so rich with insight and theology that all subsequent Christian doctrine - especially about Jesus - is based on the key themes raised in these letters.

**Other Letters**
The other eight letters, or epistles, are probably much later than Paul's. Unlike Paul's letters, they don't seem to be written with a specific community in mind. In fact, some of them are hardly letters at all - especially the First Letter of John, which reads more like a very reflective sermon, or meditation. The Letter of James could be called the first 'encyclical' because it is obviously meant to be 'circulated' among all Jewish Christians, and probably to gentile Christians with them.

**Book of Revelation**
The Book of Revelation (not the 'Book of Revelations') is the most unusual of the New Testament books. It has a lot in common with the Old Testament Book of Daniel and much Jewish literature that never made it into the official list of either Jewish or Christian Scriptures. It belongs to what is called apocalyptic literature, which for our purposes can be likened to - a kind of ancient science fiction or fantasy. The Book of Revelation is full of symbolism and references to other similar literature. It was the last of the books to be accepted by the church as revealed, and it took several centuries before Christians everywhere accepted its canonical status.
