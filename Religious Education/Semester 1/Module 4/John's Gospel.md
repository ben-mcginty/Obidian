[[Matthew's Gospel]] [[The Earliest Christian literature - Paul]] [[New Testament]] [[Intro to the New Testament]]
**John**
The Gospel of John is very different from the three synoptic gospels. The location of its writing is the most contested of any of the four gospels. Some scholars claim that it was in Ephesus; while others insist on a more Jewish setting, either near Jerusalem itself, or possibly Galilee; and others suggest Samaria. Dating is less controversial. Most scholars believe it was around the years 90-100 CE, after the widespread expulsion of the followers of Jesus from the synagogues; but J.A.T. Robinson made a very good case for a much earlier date.

John seems to have been written for a group of Jewish (and probably gentile) Christians, who did not identify with, or perhaps were expelled from, the Jewish synagogues and their traditions.

**The Message of John**
The Gospel of John begins with a poem about the incarnation (i.e. how God becomes one of us), and presents the whole of John's theology in summary. The emphasis is on Jesus as the revelation of God and on his equality with God, his divinity.

John's portrait of Jesus is the most exalted and theologically profound: John's Jesus goes far beyond the conventional Jewish and gentile expectations, especially about God. John wants his readers to realise he is presenting to them the man, Jesus, so that they will come to know the true God. The world did not know the true God, and did not hear God's word (Jn 1: 10) 'Eternal life' (Jn 3: 15) does not come from the Law but from the gracious and enduring love of God, expressed in the gift of Jesus who gave his life. John makes an enormous claim that by knowing Jesus, people can come to know God; by living as Jesus lived, they share in God's divine life.

I have come that you may have life, and have it abundantly

**- John 10:10**

John gives us the sense that Jesus' mission was leisurely, thoughtful, totally under Jesus' control, and full of symbolic actions that took several years and careful planning. In John's gospel, Jesus goes to Jerusalem at least three times, not just once as appears to be the case in the other gospels.

John has a lot of unique material - for example, the wedding at Cana, the meeting with Nicodemus and with the Samaritan woman, the woman caught in adultery, and the raising of Lazarus. The institution of the Eucharist (at the Lord's Supper) is told in terms of the 'Washing of the Feet' rather than the 'Breaking of Bread'. A profound reflection on the Eucharist is developed in telling one of the rare stories John has in common with the other three gospels: the feeding of the multitudes (Jn 6).
