[[Intro to the New Testament]] [[How was the Torah written]]
1.  What are the beatitudes?  
	    The Beatitudes are sayings attributed to Jesus, and in particular eight blessings recounted by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew, and four in the Sermon on the Plain in the Gospel of Luke, followed by four woes which mirror the blessings. Each is a proverb-like proclamation, without narrative.
2.  What is a meaning of “Pharisee”?  
	    a member of an ancient Jewish sect, distinguished by strict observance of the traditional and written law, and commonly held to have pretensions to superior sanctity.
3.  What is the “Great Commission”?
		It was the last recorded personal directive of the Savior to his disciples, and it holds great significance to all followers of Christ.
4.  Why is Mt the most Jewish Gospel?
		Matthew was seen as the first Gospel written, that Luke then expanded on Matthew, and that Mark is the conflation of both Matthew and Luke. It was believed that the Gospel of Matthew was composed by Matthew, a disciple of Jesus.
5.  Why does Mt refer to Jesus as “the son of David, the son of Abraham”?
		Jesus was called the "Son of David" while he was here on the earth. He was born in David's city, Bethlehem. The gospel of Matthew records that various people, on six different occasions.
6.  What is a Haggadah?
		The Haggadah is a Jewish text that sets forth the order of the Passover Seder. Reading the Haggadah at the Seder table is a fulfillment of the mitzvah to each Jew to "tell your children" the story from the Book of Exodus about God bringing the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm.
7.  What is Halachah?
		Halakha, also transliterated as halacha, halakhah, and halacho, is the collective body of Jewish religious laws which is derived from the written and Oral Torah.
8.  Give an example of Jesus being compared to Moses.  
	     Moses had the ministry of the law. Jesus had the ministry of grace and truth. Same traits. Both called to service.
9.  Define anti-semitism  
	    hostility to or prejudice against Jewish people
10.  Give examples of anti-semitism in the Gospel of Mt.  
	    Jesus rejects Moses and replaces it with his own.
11.  Why is the caricature of Old testament being a God of Judgement vs New Testament as a God of Love simply not true.  
	    The Old Testament scriptures describe Him more than once as “merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love.” They refer to Him as a God who “does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities”
12.  ‘His blood be on us and on our children’. Explain.  
	     They responded to Pilate's attempt to escape responsibility by accepting the blame upon themselves and their own children. This response showed the degree to which the Jewish crowd desired the death of Jesus.
13.  How is the Gospel of Mt structured to reflect the five books of the Torah?  
	    The structuring of Jesus' teaching into five discourses imitates the five books of Moses, the Torah. Therefore some scholars have proposed that Matthew presents Jesus as a New Moses
14.  Sermon on Mount: Ch 5-7. What is this sermon about?  
	    Jesus delivered this message near the beginning of His ministry and it is the longest of Jesus' sermons recorded in the New Testament . Keep in mind that Jesus wasn't a pastor of a church, so this "sermon" was different than the kind of religious messages we hear today.
15.  What is in Chapter 13 of Mt?
		Jesus continues teaching with new parables concerning weeds among the wheat and the yeast and the mustard seed. Also, Jesus explains to his disciples why he teaches with parables.           
16.  How does the ending of Mt universalise the message of Jesus?
		Jesus’ final blow to the Torah comes in a closing parable at the end of the Sermon on the Mount. He tells the story of a wise man who builds his house on the rock and a foolish man who builds his house on sand.
17.  Mt 5:17. “ I have not come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have come to fulfil. Not one letter of the law will pass.” What is the message Matthew is giving to his readers here?
		Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.
18.  Mt 5:21 Matthean antitheses. Mt 5:27. Mt 5:38. The new standard is higher than the old. What is the purpose of these statements by Matthew?
		He's saying that we should turn to God.
19.  Mt 15. What does Matthew say about the kosher (food) laws?
		All foods are clean, so we don't need to keep kosher according to Jesus. Its more important for whats happening in your heart and in your mind according to Matthew.
20.  Where does Matthew portray Jesus as the founder of the Church?
		On a big rock
21.  In what way is Mt 16:18 a source of conflict between Roman Catholics and Protestants?
		Both Protestants and Catholics believe there is a visible and invisible aspect to the church. • The Roman Catholic Church believes they are the only true visible manifestation of the body of Christ on earth. Protestants disagree.
22.  Chapter 13: What is the point made by the parable of the sower?
		A man’s reception of God’s Word is determined by the condition of his heart.”. A secondary lesson would be “Salvation is more than a superficial, albeit joyful"
23.  Mt paints Jesus as a teacher. Mt 13:15. What is the meaning of the householder bringing out things “new and old”.

24.  Mt 4:12. Jesus withdraws. (Retreats in the face of danger). Also see Mt 12:15. Why is Jesus retreating (in the mind of Matthew)?

25.  Mt 10:23. Disciples should also retreat in the face of danger. In what way is Jesus a model for the disciples, and the disciples a model for the church?

26.  Mt 14:22. Compare Mk 6:45. The stilling of the storm. What does the boat symbolise in this story? What does the storm represent? Who does Peter represent?
