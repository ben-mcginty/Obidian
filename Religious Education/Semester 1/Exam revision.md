**Tips from your teachers**
Make sure your answers are obviously based on what you learnt in class, not general knowledge. We are looking for evidence of learning from the course you have just studied.

One way to demonstrate Critical Analysis might be to consider how an uninformed reader might misunderstand something and then you demonstrate what you have learnt. For example: “to the untrained eye, it may appear that Jesus in Mark’s gospel was secretive or didn’t want to be ‘found out’ as the Messiah, however Mark used the ‘Messianic Secret’ motif to emphasise that it is not Jesus’ miracles that make him the messiah but his suffering and dying that makes Jesus the Messiah.
