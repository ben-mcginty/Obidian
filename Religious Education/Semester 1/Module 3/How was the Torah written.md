The first 5 books are the books of law, they are the Torah, or Pentateuch [[TaNaK]]

For 100's of years, people believed that Moses was the sole author of the torah.

They came to this conclusion because Moses is written about in third person, and his death is written down.

As many scholars study the bible in depth, Moses was refrenced in 3rd person.

In 1750, jean d'Astruc suggested that there are at least two different authors, becasue of two names for god. Elohim and YHWH (Yahweh).

In the 18th century, various names of god were identified, and gradually scholars accepted that there were more than one author, but cannot agree with how they were involved.

The torah contained

-   Various literary generas
-   Various literary styles
-   Varying vocabulary
-   Varying worldviews
-   Duplicated accounts of biblical stories
-   Other incosistensies

Julius welllhausen concluded that 5 books are a combination od 4 earlier sources. Documenty theory or the Four Source Theory.
