# Meaning and Function
[[Meaning of]] [[Meaning and Function - definition and example]] [[How to read a story]]
Learn this:

1) Stories have a **meaning** and **function.** 

2) It is very easy to misunderstand the meaning and function as we saw in the tortoise and hare activity. It is very common that religious literature is misunderstood because it is from a different world. 

3) Stories can have religious meaning, political meaning, national meaning.

This video tells the story of the History of the State of Origin rugby league competition (A sports game between two Australian states).

In the first 5 seconds the filmmaker sets the scene: People walking in slow motion straight lines and randomly appearing bursts of fire as the voice overs have a conversation about being ready for something. As if possessed one of the people walking in a straight line screams 'queenslander' with no context. It is a strange story. Can you explain it better than me?

1) At 0:09 the voice over says "this is super-human" - is this a lie, or a mistake, or something else?

2) At 0:20 the voice over says "at the end of the day, it is the toughest who will survive". Does this leave you thinking that some of the players will not survive the game?  Why not?

When your brain watches this kind of story, it can very easily say subconsciously "oh, this is commercially produced marketing that is really about...." and THAT is where you start to consider the **meaning** and **function** of the story.

1) So what is the meaning and function of that "history of the State of Origin"?

2) what does this story imply about QLD, NSW or Australia?

**National Meaning**

Nations have national identities, and we tell ourselves stories that convey **national meaning**.  The Anzac story is one Australians tell to express and share our identity as larrikins who value mateship. The NRL story above expresses and shares the identity that Australians are tough.  Of course, there is no reason to really believe that Australians are tougher, mateyer or more larrikinish than any other nation, but that is just what people do - how boring would it be if the NRL advertisement simply said "we like state of origin" ot the Anzac story was told in a plain and uninspiring way.

**Political Meaning**

Sometimes stories are told to persuade people towards a particular political preference.  This can be very tricky, but consider the stories your family share with you, or your school.  Consider any popular film and google it with "political agenda" and something is likely to come up.  Some examples: ([Toy Story (Links to an external site.)](https://exclaim.ca/film/article/tony_hale_sheds_light_on_the_political_message_of_toy_story_4), [Frozen (Links to an external site.)](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-12-02/frozen-2-climate-change-mental-health)). What are the meaning and function of these stories?

**Religious Meaning**

Obviously, many stories have something to say about faith, god, religious observances etc. The Simpsons is a great example of this with Religion being a major theme.

God is the only 5 fingered character (image and likeness of the creators)   
God's face is never shown (transcendence)

What is the meaning and function of this story?

So, now that you know about religious meaning, political meaning, and national meaning national meaning. What can you say about the **meaning** of Ezekiel 37 (read the NRSV version on oxford biblical studies).
