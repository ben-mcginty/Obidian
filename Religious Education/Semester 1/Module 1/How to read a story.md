# How to Read a Story
[[Meaning and Function]] [[Meaning and Function - definition and example]]
**Be humble!**

-   if the story has remained in existence for millenia, then it was probably composed by people who are at least as intelligent as us
-   readers of the C21st often have a post enlightenment scientific approach to understanding facts, but all the stories in this unit do not
-   it takes skill to imagine the world where the story comes from
-   though we do have tools at our disposal: archeology, anthropology, linguistics, sociology, geography, ancient history. These all inform scripture study

**No need to judge!**

-   we are not here to decide if the stories are true, but to learn what truths they conveyed to their culture - these stories were written for the people of the day; the authors most probably had little or no concept that people would be reading them 3000 years into the future!
-   there will be wisdom for us too - though it may take some effort to discover this!
-   the story alone is not enough to extract the full meaning and wisdom - context is essential!

**Three types of truth:**

There are three approaches to truth.  Use the link below, or another reputable reference to find an explanation of each and give an example.
