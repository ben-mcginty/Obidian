The Hare & the Tortoise

A Hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow.

"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.

"Yes," replied the Tortoise, "and I get there sooner than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it."

The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started the runners off.

The Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Hare, he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up.

The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the Hare was sleeping. But the Hare slept on very peacefully; and when at last he did wake up, the Tortoise was near the goal. The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time.

1) What is the story about? 

This story is about the fact that the hare is overconfident in his capabilities, and would be able to overtake anyone.

2) What was the author's intention? [[Meaning of]]

To tell the reader that:

If you never stop trying, and work hard, you will get to your goal.

Never become to cocky, arrogant or overconfident in your abilities.

3) What's wrong with this question asked by a small girl: "But, animals can't talk, and wouldn't the fox just eat the hare?" [[What do myths mean]]

It's a story to explain something, it's not rooted in fact.

Go, eat your bread with enjoyment, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has long ago approved what you do.  Let your garments always be white; do not let oil be lacking on your head.  Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life that are given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun. Whatever your hand finds to do, do with your might; for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.

Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favour to the skilful; but time and chance happen to them all. For no one can anticipate the time of disaster. Like fish taken in a cruel net, and like birds caught in a snare, so mortals are snared at a time of calamity, when it suddenly falls upon them.

1) What is the story about?

The story is about someone eating, and keeping them clean, happpy and healthy.

2) What was the author's intention?

To be humble and to work for what you have, as well as equal opportunity.

3) What similarities and differences can you observe in the stories?

Don't rush through life, don't take things for granted, and to slow down to enjoy life.

Sometimes stories address the same theme, both The Tortise and The Hare and Ecclesiastes have something to say about how to win at life. They both contain famous lines: "slow and steady wins the race" and "the race is not to the swift". 

1) What similarities and differences can you observe in the authors' intentions regarding how to win at life?

They are both telling you to work hard and to enjoy life. The bible excert is harder to understand and is more wordy.

2) which story is hardest to understand? What do you need to know to understand it better?

The latter, and hindsight

3) What can you find on the internet about the contexts in which these stories were written?

The T&H story is to explain to little kids, the bible one is for adults. The T&H is based on the bible tale, but the bible one was written earlier.
