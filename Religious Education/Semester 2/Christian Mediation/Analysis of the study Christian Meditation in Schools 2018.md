Key findings

Quotes

Many students found Christian Meditation to offer a valuable space for

experiencing a connection with God, and for bringing them closer to God

over time, with many students describing profound experiences of listening,

talking or revering being in His presence.

• Experiencing Christian Meditation had expanded many students’

understandings of prayer.

• There was a reported decline in students’ religious behaviour (such as church

attendance).

• There may be a degree of tension between the relaxation benefits, a

contemporary or eclectic experience of spirituality and the Christian or

Catholic basis of the practice for some students.

• No association was found between the practice of Christian Meditation and

students’ relationship with the Catholic Church.

• The teachers were uncertain about the impact of Christian Meditation upon

students’ relationship with God. This was not something readily discussed in

the class and teachers were hesitant to postulate about this.
