Meditation is global and worldwide for everyone.

If you're serious about finding peace, be serious about meditation

Use a mantra (Maranatha) to focus

Also don't judge your progress. The fruit of silent prayer is proof.

And is called to share in the transcendent life through the mind of Christ—for Christ prays in us.

Ability to open your soul to god

Makes us more peaceful and more open to other people

Dot point summary:

-   Meditation is a form of prayer that focuses on reflection.
-   Christian meditation is very different to non-Christian meditation, such as yoga.
-   Non-Christian meditation practices aim at emptying the mind, whereas Christian meditation is about filling the mind with God and growing in our relationship with God.
-   In Christian meditation we use our intellect to know the Triune God, to understand God's love for us, and to grow in union with God.
-   We also use our ability to think and reason, as well as imagine.
-   We bring to meditation what we know in our minds about God.
-   Then we ask God to translate this knowledge into a different kind of knowing, which is the knowledge in our hearts of God as Father and intimate friend.

Where is meditation being introduced?

In Primary and Secondary schools

Why is meditation being encouraged?

"Maybe have not had any religious formation since they were at school, so this is a way of going deeper and looking at the big questions in life, the purpose and where am I and where do I fit."

How is meditation done?

"Sit in stillness and silence, and meditate, they're simple, they get it, ducks to water."

What does the Christian prayer word 'Maranatha' mean?

"Meaning translated Come Lord, but you don't think of that during your time of meditation, you just repeat it, as best you can, with love and attention."
