Ideas in the quote which reflect the Christian Meditation method.

Gregory of Nyssa

4th century

“Every concept grasped by the mind becomes an obstacle in the quest to those who search.”

Evagrius Ponticus

4th century

“When you are praying do not shape within yourself any image of the deity and do not let your mind be shaped by the impress of any form. Approach the immaterial in an immaterial manner. Prayer means the shedding of thought.”

St. Augustine

4th-5th century

“The best one can say about God is for one to keep silent out of the wisdom of one’s inward riches. So be silent and don’t chatter about God. For when you do chatter about God, you are telling lies and sinning.”

St. John Cassian

4th-5th century

“The mind thus casts out and represses the rich and ample matter of all thoughts and restricts itself to the poverty of a single verse.”

“Let the mind hold ceaselessly to this formula above all until it has been strengthened by constantly using and continually meditating upon it, and until it renounces and rejects the whole wealth and abundance of thoughts. This straitened by the poverty of this verse, it will easily attain to that gospel beatitude which holds the first place among the other beatitudes. For, it says, ‘Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”

Symeon, the New

Theologian

10th-11th century

“Sit down quietly, and alone, bow your head, shut your eyes, breathe slowly and look with

the powers of your imagination into your heart, and lead your reasons, that is, your thoughts from the head to the heart. With

each breath, you should say, ‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me!’ you should express the words slowly and quietly, with

the lips or only with the breath.”

The Cloud of Unknowing

14th century

“So take a little word of just one syllable to help focus your attention. The shorter the word the better, because it is more like this particular activity of the Holy Spirit. Chose a word like “God” or “love” or any word of one syllable that appeals to you and impress it indelibly on your heart so that it is always there, whatever happens.”

“Use this little word and pray not in many words but in a little word of one syllable. Fix this word fast to your heart so that it is always there come what may. With this word, you will suppress all thoughts.”

St. John of the Cross

16th century

“I entered into unknowing. Yet when I saw myself, without knowing where I was I understood great things. I will not say what I felt for I remained in unknowing, transcending all knowledge. That perfect knowledge was a peace and holiness held in profound solitude. It was something so secret that I left stammering, transcending all knowledge.”

Theophan the Recluse

19th century

“To pray is to descend with the mind into the heart, and there to stand before the face of the Lord, ever-present, all-seeing, within you.”

Thomas Merton

20th century

“Contemplative prayer is, in a way, simply the preference for the desert, for emptiness, for poverty. One has begun to know the meaning of contemplation when one intuitively and spontaneously seeks the dark and unknown path of aridity in preference to every other way..”
