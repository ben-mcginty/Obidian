The Four Noble Truths

1

LIFE IS FULL OF DUKKHA (SUFFERING)

This is a recognition of the state of the world: The Buddha says: “Birth involved suffering, old age involves suffering, sickness involves suffering, death involves suffering, lamentation, dejection and despair involve suffering.  Contact with unpleasant things involve suffering, not getting one’s wishes involves suffering.”

The despair and dissatisfaction that characterises most of existence, has causes, and if these causes can be identified, then the despair can be eliminated as well. The Buddha considers that the unsatisfactory nature of life is most obvious at key points in life but the whole of the present life is in some sense unsatisfactory.

-   1) The suffering of pain which is common to animals and humans. One can temporarily escape this type of suffering.
-   2)The suffering of change. When we first get or do something new it may be regarded as pleasurable, but thereafter the pleasure fades. This often happens in relationships or when going to a new place – they initially satisfy but then do not. This leads to human beings constantly seeking new experiences or stimulation.
-   3) The suffering of ignorance – this is when we take appearances to be truth rather than looking beneath them.

TANHA (SELFISH DESIRE) IS THE CAUSE OF LIFE BEING UNSATISFACTORY

The origin of suffering is desire. Desire also leads to ignorance as it leads to being dominated by externals and this leads away from wisdom.

The Buddha is echoed in Plato who considered that the soul is bondage, through ignorance, to the things of the world.

Desire ties the individual to the world and this brings about the continuous cycle of birth and death which causes the suffering. The Buddhist aims to be set free from this cycle.

In modern terms, the ego seen as an agglomeration of ‘wants’ such as money, power, sex, possessions, etc. These are the causes of despair and dissatisfaction with life.

The Dalai Lama makes clear that there are two types of desire:

1)  Desire without a reason or for a poor reason  – e.g. “I want this, I want that”.  This is desire for impermanent things.

2) Desire with a good purpose. This leads to determination and the elimination of ignorance.

It is a mistake, therefore, to hold that all desire is wrong – the desire to take control of one’s mind, to be compassionate, to achieve nirvana is a GOOD desire.

IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE UNSATISFACTORY NATURE OF LIFE TO BE BROUGHT TO AN END

-   Attachment to the pleasures of the senses and to life are the most important forms of attachment which form the sole cause of suffering.
-   If the desire to live, as well as all other desires, can be overcome - if the craving for pleasure, sensuous enjoyment and rebirth can be eliminated, then suffering can be transcended.
-   We need to stop desiring, to stop saying ‘I want’, to stop craving material things or feelings.
-   Life is like a wagon with four wheels which carries people through life. The wheels are:
-   1) The wheel of bodily needs – freedom from hunger, cold and illness
-   2) The wheel of love – loving and being loved
-   3) The wheel of worldly aims and pursuits
-   4) The wheel of spiritual aims
-   But people pile up their wagons with so many possessions and they  crave more and more so that the load is too heavy and the wheels break. Once broken, the wheels are difficult to mend –such as the wheel of health and the wheel of love. People are willing to die for their possessions and if they do not have enough they are dissatisfied with their lives.

THE PATH TO LIBERATION

-   The eradication of the ego/self is of fundamental importance. However this is NOT a desire of extinction.
-   The ego/self is to be eliminated but the individual can still attain Nirvana – or enlightenment. There is an apparent tension here but it is apparent rather than real. The self that attains enlightenment is purged from all selfishness, self-interest and egocentricity.

The Eightfold Path

1

RIGHT KNOWLEDGE

-   Suffering is caused by ignorance, knowledge is a first step to overcoming this. The first step is to recognize that life is full of Dukkha (suffering). Unless we are willing to recognize the unsatisfactory nature of our present state, we will not seek to overcome it. This requires accepting the Four Noble Truths.
-   Once ignorance is eliminated, suffering ceases – this is ‘moksha’ or liberation. When one realizes that all things are impermanent and that desire leads to emptiness, suffering is overcome.
-   This process can be helped by mixing with others who are also seeking wisdom or enlightenment.

2

RIGHT INTENTION or ATTITUDE

-   It is not enough to know the right thing, it is necessary to have the right intention to put the knowledge into practice. It was this that Plato did not recognize – knowledge alone does not bring right action.
-   Our moods and uncontrolled feelings damage ourselves most of all and we need to correct these. When we hurt others, we hurt ourselves more. We must want to change.

3

-   RIGHT SPEECH

-   This involves only saying things which are just and virtuous – not telling lies, not slandering people and not speaking frivolously, harshly or unnecessarily.
-   This involves being aware of what we say and thinking about our words before we use them. We can learn about ourselves by being attending to what we say - then we can begin to change.
-   These first three lead to….

4

RIGHT ACTION

-   Actions without knowledge and intention are pointless, but actions in accordance with right intention are vital. The Buddha rejected religious rituals such as bathing in the river Ganges, the holy river of Hinduism, as such rituals do not help to overcome selfhood. Right action is summed up in Five precepts:
-   (1) I will not harm living beings; (2) I will not take what is not given; (3) I will avoid harmful sexual activity; (4) I will avoid hurtful speech and (4) I will not take drugs or drink that confuse the mind.

5

-   RIGHT LIVING

-   ‘Right living’ is closely connected to ‘Right action’. It involves freedom from deception, from lying and misleading people, from self-aggrandizement. It involves building a pure character. It is equivalent to Virtue Ethics.
-   The Buddha recommended his followers should avoid being an arms or slave dealer, someone who sells poisons, a prostitute, a brewer or a butcher.
-   This is enjoined by the Buddha as the most essential pre-requisite for an aspirant. It means releasing the whole character from the ignoble life of self-indulgence to the life of the saint.

6

-   RIGHT EFFORT

-   Five steps*  are necessary to maintaining right action on a continuous basis through one’s own will:
-   A) Attending to good ideas
-   B) Facing the dangers to the self that will result from practicing bad ideas.
-   C) Turning attention away from bad ideas
-   D) Analyzing the causes of the bad ideas to counteract the temptation, and
-   E) Causing the mind to reject the bad ideas through bodily effort.

RIGHT MINDFULNESS

-   This is the key to meditation and involves the use of reason to control emotions. It involves seeing things as they really are by a careful scrutiny of whatever impinges on our consciousness.
-   ‘It is a matter of entering into the present moment and seeing all things, present, past and even future, in relation to that point.’ (Michael Barnes sj)
-   Fear, sorrow, anger, jealousy and hope all dominate human beings yet reason can be used to provide a steady and consistent state of being which is not dominated by instinct, emotion or transitory feelings.
-   The Dhammapada (Sayings of the Buddha) opens by saying ‘All we are is the result of what we have thought’
-   “Our mind is out of control. It is just like a monkey jumping about senselessly. It goes upstairs, gets bored, runs back downstairs, gets tired of that, goes to the movie, gets bored again, has good food or poor food, gets bored with that.” (Ajahn Chah ‘A Still Forest Pool’)
-   The aim of meditation is to control the mind, not to let the flitting mind control you. We are not our minds – our minds can be controlled and directed. The aim is to find peace and stillness – and through this wisdom or enlightenment.

RIGHT CONCENTRATION ON MEDITATION

-   Meditation leads to tranquility and four stages are suggested:
-   1) The first stage flows from a life of seclusion, insight and reflection – it involves contemplating and seeking to understand truths. This stage brings joy.
-   2) The second stage brings a development of the joy and a calmness and serenity of mind,
-   3) The third stage involves the disappearance of passion. Individuality ceases to matter and one may no longer want to live,
-   4) The last stage brings complete peace having transcended all worries and even earthly joy (This is ‘Samadhi’).
