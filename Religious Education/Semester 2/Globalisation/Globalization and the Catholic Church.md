Make notes on this article under the following sub-headings:

## Globalization: liberation or exploitation?
Globalization refers to world-wide connections, growth and maintenance of transnational institutions and agreed upon ways of acting for what is perceived as the good of the planet. All of this is possible because technology has created multiple connections

Globalization is the growing economic interdependence of countries worldwide caused by the increasing volume and variety of cross-border transactions in goods and services and international capital.

Fr. J. Bryan Hehir sees this definition as inadequate because it does not address other aspects of human life such as the social and cultural dimensions.

A study of the cultural and social dimensions on the local level reveals the considerable inequities that exist in so many countries.

"This is evident throughout the world in vast pockets of poverty (both urban and rural), the agricultural breakdown of small scale and organic farming, the widespread creation of imagined needs through advertising, the rampant waste and emptiness of mindless consumerism, and the relentless deterioration of the global environment. For all these reasons the growing tension between the developed countries of the North and the developing countries of the South remains the critical issue of contention at the United Nations."

 The list of negative effects of economic globalization is long.    

Globalization has been possible because of scientific and technological advances that, in themselves, can be considered a blessing for the human race. But when all of reality is reduced to what can be empirically measured, serious problems follow.

There must also be development in the areas of peoples' lives besides the material one. "One does not live on bread alone" (Matt 4:4). One is also fed religiously and culturally. One's stomach may be full but one's dignity can be savaged and one's self-esteem can be diminished.

Globalization has become especially problematic in our present time because just as we are becoming more creation-centered, more aware of our interconnectedness not only with our fellow human beings but with the non-human world as well, our economic globalization is pushing us in the opposite direction.

We are becoming increasingly responsible for our planet. Less and less is left to the evolutionary process and natural selection. The survival of the diversity of life which the earth has so wonderfully enjoyed for centuries is now in our hands.

## Solidarity with the poor
Catholic thinkers often refer to the words of Pope John Paul II that "globalization, a priori, is neither good nor bad. It will be what people make of it."6 That is the question before us.

I have made the point that at the heart of the difficulty with globalization is the lack of imagination. Kenan Osborne makes this same point. He says that a church that is using its imagination is one that is looking outward, not gazing inward. In fact, he says it is the only thing that the church can do if it wants to have a role in the contemporary globalized world.

Not to imagine and not to dream will doom the church to sit on the sidelines of history. Imagination has a point of departure: the now. Imagination also has a point of arrival: the future. Imagination and dreaming, therefore, requires a two-direction vision.

## Global sign of the cross
The Christian perspective must be found in terms of the cross. It is the scandal of the cross that gives new insights into the human person and the needed motivation to deal with human suffering.

"The cross opens our eyes to the perspective of the victims of history: more precisely, today's victims of globalization. The concern for the poor and the victims and respect for their interpretation of facts and their longing for liberation is not merely a Christian attitude; it is of concern for all of us."8

The cross is a constant check against a superficial engagement with suffering or a too optimistic trust in advancement solely through technological means. The presence of the cross can make the church ever watchful of being seduced by the market or the latest forms of communication. When the power of the cross sits in judgment on globalization, the cross calls upon the church to look upon the social, political and especially economic dimensions of life with new eyes.

Having access to a hermeneutical horizon that is different from the dominant interpretive frameworks of our time, and inspired by new root metaphors, it (church) can contribute to transforming globalization into a process of humanization.

## Four new root metaphors
So, what are the new root metaphors which are emerging from the life of the church? What is the different framework of understanding that comes from a church when it is in contact with the victims of globalization? Johan Verstraeten suggests four new root metaphors which he sees as critical for a new understanding on the part of the church as it strives to minister in a globalized world.

In the case of globalization, it is the perspective of the cross as it casts new light on the victims of history and, in particular, the victims of globalization, that can provide this imaginative thrust. Looking at the cross can open our eyes to any attempts to take too optimistic a view of human progress that dismisses the sufferings of the poor.

The point is that the church cannot remain on the level of repeating certain moral principles, especially if they have the musty smell of natural law, and unchanging tradition or the attitude of "it has ever been so." That is not pastoral leadership based on discernment. That is not the cross and the gospels that interpret it. Such an approach injects little energy or motivation to move beyond the status quo, still enclosed in a world dominated by the principles of modernism.

## Worshipping globally
What observations  can we make on the areas where globalization must be taken into account in any project of liturgical inculturation?

1. The almost consecrated phrase of Christian social ethics is: think globally, act locally. This is true whether it refers to the church or the World Bank. For example, ethics must have a universal character based on the truth about ourselves as persons, but it must also avoid becoming too abstract. We can easily agree that any meaningful teaching of the church or principle of the World Bank must "take into account the experience of people at the grassroots level."15

Most theologians would take for granted that since there is no church in general, there can be no liturgy in general.

To act locally must attend to the fact that globalization is an uneven process. One still finds the usual division of domination and subordination in many cultures, but what it means to control and to be controlled will be different concretely.

There is a push-pull dialectic in contemporary globalization. The dynamics of a globalized world are ever in play, destroying one's sense of identity as tied to a specific locality. There is at the same time a clinging to a final place for identity purposes. This is because we are embodied and need to be physically located. Globalization cannot mean the end of locality. But even our physical space is being transformed into something more complex.

One cannot accurately read the signs of the times if one still operates spiritually out of a sacred/secular dichotomy. Prayer life and work life must be brought together.

What is called for here is the development of a Catholic social conscience; a faith that does justice that is connected with all other dimensions of one's religious life. There have been repeated calls for a liturgy that does justice, but more is needed. Speaking of Catholic social sensitivity, William F. Ryan makes this suggestion:

"It needs to be preached regularly in every parish. However, I believe church leaders should put the highest priority in fostering the creation of small prayer and social-faith groupings of lay adults, such as the base communities in Brazil and elsewhere. Without such an ongoing adult lay formation in their faith, potential and actual lay Catholic leaders will continue to be handicapped in finding Christ in their professional activity. And today, these small groups can be mutually inspired and challenged by relating regularly to believers of other faiths."

The liturgy is probably our best way to see with new eyes. We must see beyond not only economic, political and cultural globalization. We must see through the eyes of the poor. Increasingly, Catholicism lives among the poor. In the future the majority of Catholics will be living in poor countries.

3.  A major if not the most important consideration for liturgy in the 21st century's confrontation with globalization is ecological. We are at an important moment in our history. As we become more interdependent and realize that we live in the midst of a great diversity of cultures, we are also aware of our connection to the earth. We sense that it is increasingly fragile.

## Applying the cross
The challenge is to apply the cross and the new root metaphors as well as the two previous observations about acting locally and seeing with new eyes to what Tucker calls an "ecological reformation." She suggests five areas which must be revisited with a new vision and the courage to reframe them,

## Who will do this?
This is the challenge now before the church with its rich liturgical tradition and vast intellectual resources. Globalization is happening. What kind of world will emerge from it is rightly our concern and work.
