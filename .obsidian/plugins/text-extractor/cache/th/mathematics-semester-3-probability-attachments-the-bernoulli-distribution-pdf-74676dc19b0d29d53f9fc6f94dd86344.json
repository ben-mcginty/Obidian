Learning outcomes: • To know the definition of a Bernoulli random variable • To be able to calculate the mean and variance of a Bernoulli random variable. 3 The Bernoulli distribution arises from considering the result of a single trial of an experiment. 45678 𝑉𝑎𝑟 𝑋 = 𝑝 1 − 𝑝 = 𝑝 − 𝑝2 Var(X) is maximised when 𝑝 = 1 2 9 Combinations (revision) There are a total of 10 combinations of the 5 letters taken 3 at a time. This is written as 𝐶3 5 = 10 or 5 3 = 10 10 On the calculator 𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ → 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏 → 3 11 Recall: Pr 𝐸 = 𝑛 𝐸 𝑛 𝑠 The probability of an event is the number of ways the event can occur over the number in the sample space (total number of outcomes) So in the problem above the probability of selecting a team of 3, which contains the captain, from a squad of 8 is: 1 1 7 2 8 3 = 0.375 121314 EXERCISE 5.01 (PAGE 202) • Question 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
