The probability function is 𝑃 𝑋 = 𝑥 = 𝑞𝑥𝑝 3 The pattern in the previous example is termed a Geometric Distribution. Note: unlike the other distributions this distribution is not finite. The Geometric distribution is the probability distribution of the number of failures of Bernoulli trials before the first success. The probability function is 𝑃 𝑋 = 𝑥 = 𝑞𝑥𝑝 𝑋 has the values 0, 1, 2, 3, … 𝑋𝜖𝐽+ The probability function is a geometric sequence. Recall the infinite sum of a Geometric Series with a common ratio 𝑟 is given by 𝑎 1−𝑟 provided −1 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 1 Hence σ 𝑞𝑥𝑝 = 𝑝 1−𝑞 = 1−𝑞 1−𝑞 = 1 The expected value of a geometric distribution is 𝐸 𝑋 = 𝑞 1−𝑞 = 1−𝑝 𝑝 4 In a bottling plant a problem has been discovered with a labelling machine. It has been determined that 25% of all labels are not properly applied to the bottles. If 𝑋 denotes the number of labels that are fixed correctly before the first one is not fixed properly, calculate: a) 𝑃(𝑋 = 5) b) 𝑃 𝑋 ≤ 5 c) 𝐸 𝑋 and explain the result. 56 Exercise 5.02 Page 208 Nelson Senior Maths 78910111213 EXERCISE 5.02 (PAGE 208) • Question 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
