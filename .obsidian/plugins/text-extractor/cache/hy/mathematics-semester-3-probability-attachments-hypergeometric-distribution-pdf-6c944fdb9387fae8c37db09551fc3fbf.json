The random variable is the number of successes. For the hypergeometric random variable 𝑋, 𝑃 𝑋 = 𝑥 = 𝑘 𝑥 𝑁−𝑘 𝑛−𝑥 𝑁 𝑛 where 𝑥 ≤ 𝑛 and𝑥 ≤ 𝑘. Note: 𝐸 𝑋 = 𝑛 𝑘 𝑁 𝑁 = population size 𝑘 = number of successes in population 𝑛 = number of trials 𝑥 = successes we are looking for. 567 Which of the following in not a characteristic of a hypergeometric probability experiment? 8 Four cards are drawn from a well shuffled standard deck of playing cards. What is the probability two of the four cards are hearts? An electrical appliance has 6 transistors. It is know that two of the transistors are faulty but it is not known which two. If three transistors are randomly selected what is the probability that one of the three is faulty? It is known that 18% of a batch of 50 computer chips are defective. If 10 chips are selected for testing what is the probability that 4 of the chips are defective? 9101112 EXERCISE 2.05 (PAGE 70) • Question 2, 3, 5, 6, 10","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
