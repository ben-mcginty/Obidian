-   To really understand big data, it’s helpful to have some historical background. Here is Gartner’s definition, circa 2001 (which is still the go-to definition)
-   Big data is data that contains a greater **variety** arriving in increasing **volumes** and with ever-higher **velocity**. This is known as the 3Vs.
-   These massive volumes of data can be used to address business problems you wouldn’t have been able to tackle before.

It wasn't long before that there needed to be added another V, that of **veracity.** That is the **truthfulness** of the data that we are collecting.

Then came along the 5th V of Big Data, that of **Value** since without that the other 4V's don't really count that much.

There are many different visualisations of the 4Vs or 5 Vs from a simple text-based table of definitions and example to more graphical ones. Some of these are included in the powerpoint/sway presentation.

**Exercise: Do a web search and find one that appeals to you and add it to the discussion page topic**
