- Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise, deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.
- Data with many cases (rows) offer greater statistical power,
- Data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.  (Wikipedia)

Another view of Big Data is a term used to describe a collection of data that is:

- Huge in size and growing exponentially over time.
    -   Created quickly
    -   Changing rapidly
    -   Large and complex that none of the traditional data management tools are able to store it or process it efficiently.
